`I plan on starting a freelance analytics business.  I'm developing a list of prompts to help me build a solid foundational understanding of the business.  Here are a few of my prompts that have been valueable so far.

- With the information I've provided, develop me a comprehensive narrative on the business background narrative.
- With the information I've provided, develop me a comprehensive narrative on the business problem to explore.
- With the data fields and descriptions provided, give me their respective data types and the business significance of each data field.  Please format this in a table so I can have a data dictionary to reference.

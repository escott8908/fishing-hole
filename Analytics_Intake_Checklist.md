# The Analytics Intake Checklist (A Repeatable Framework)

To consistently frame problems well, it helps to use a repeatable intake process for new projects. Whether
you formalize it as a questionnaire, a checklist, or just a mental guide, having standard questions and steps
will ensure you cover all bases before analysis begins. You can adapt this framework to an intake form or
your initial client meetings. Below is a practical Business Problem Framing Checklist for freelance data
analytics projects:

## Clarify the Business Objective and Motivation:
1. What primary goal is the client trying to achieve or what pain point are they addressing? (e.g. “increase
monthly donations”, “reduce patient wait times”, “boost online sales conversion”).
2. Why does this goal matter to the organization’s success or mission? Ensure the problem is linked to a
business driver (revenue, cost, customer satisfaction, compliance, etc.).
3. How does the client perceive this problem? (Hear it in their words – it reveals assumptions and context.)

## Define Success Criteria and Metrics:
4. How will we measure success or know if the problem is solved? Identify key metrics or KPIs that relate to
the problem (sales growth %, churn rate, NPS, etc.).
5. Are there specific targets or benchmarks? (e.g. “increase NPS by 10 points” or “reduce costs by $100k
per quarter”). If not given, consider helping the client set a realistic target.
6. What is the baseline/current value of those metrics? (So you know where you’re starting from.)

## Understand Context and Scope:
7. What is the background of this problem? (Recent trends, events, or known issues that led to the ask.
E.g. “sales dipped after a competitor opened store nearby” or “donor churn increased since last
year’s campaign”.)
8. Which parts of the business are in scope? (Specific product lines, departments, customer segments,
time periods, etc. E.g. “focus on Q1-Q3 of this year, online sales channel only.”)
9. What is out of scope? (Any areas not to analyze or decisions already made to exclude certain factors.
E.g. “assume pricing remains unchanged” or “exclude international markets”.)
10. Who are the stakeholders? (Who requested this, who will use the results, and who might be impacted?
List key names/roles. This tells you whose needs to consider and who to loop in for insights or data.)

## Identify Available Data and Resources:
11. What data sources are available and relevant to this problem? 10 (Sales database, Google Analytics,
patient records, survey data, etc.)
12. Do we have access to these data sources? (Permissions, systems, etc. Don’t assume – check early.)
13. What is the quality and completeness of the data? (Are there known data issues, gaps or delays? 12 For
example, “website conversion data is complete for last 2 years, but missing for older periods” or
“customer feedback data is qualitative and not standardized.”)
14. Are there external data sources to include? (Market benchmarks, census data, open data, etc., if
relevant. Also ask if using such data is allowed or advisable 22 11 .)
15. What tools or technology will be used? (Excel, Python, BI tools, etc., and any constraints there. Also,
does the client expect a certain format of deliverable – dashboard, slide deck, written report?)

## Timeline and Urgency:
16. Are there any deadlines for this analysis or decision? (e.g. “We need initial findings by next board
meeting on Oct 15” or “the campaign launches next month, so we need insights within 2 weeks.”)
17. Is this a one-time analysis or ongoing? (One-off report vs. building a repeatable model or dashboard.
This affects how you frame the work.)
18. If predictive, for what timeframe is the prediction needed? (Next quarter, next year, etc. – ensures you
align with planning cycles.)

## Expected Action and Audience:
19. What decision will be made or action taken from this analysis? 8 (Ensure there is an answer to this – it
validates the project’s value. E.g. “decide whether to increase marketing spend in Channel A vs B,” or
“invest in hiring more support staff if wait times are due to understaffing.”)
20. Who will see or use the deliverables? (Just the requester, or a broader audience like an executive team,
or even external partners? 23 Knowing the audience helps determine the level of detail and how to
present findings. A technical team might want detailed data; executives want big-picture and clear
recommendations.)
21. How will the results be delivered and communicated? (A formal presentation, a written report, an
interactive dashboard? This isn’t framing the problem per se, but helps ensure your output aligns
with what the client expects to actually use. It can also influence how you frame sub-questions; e.g. if
it’s a dashboard, the problem might be broken into key metrics to display.)

## Constraints and Assumptions:
22. What constraints should we keep in mind? (Budget limits, compliance rules, technological constraints,
etc. E.g. “Must use anonymized data due to privacy,” or “cannot survey customers directly, must rely
on existing data.” These will shape the approach and need to be acknowledged in framing.)
23. Any initial hypotheses or assumptions from the client? (Clients often have a hunch – “I think the issue
might be pricing” – note these down. They can be tested, but also help frame the analysis path. Just
be careful not to treat assumptions as facts.)
24. What not to do? Sometimes clients have particular approaches they do or don’t want (e.g. “no
complicated ML model, leadership just wants a simple analysis they can trust”). Document any such
preferences now.

## Confirm the Problem Statement:
After gathering all the above, summarize the business problem in a clear statement (or a few
bullet points) and play it back to the client for confirmation. For example: “So, our objective is to
identify the key drivers of customer churn among premium subscribers in the last 12 months and propose
data-driven strategies to improve retention, aiming to reduce churn rate from 15% to 10% by next year.
We’ll use transaction and support ticket data for this analysis, and success means we come away with clear
recommendations that the client success team can implement. Does that sound right?” Getting explicit
agreement here is crucial. It ensures you and the client have a shared understanding before moving
forward.

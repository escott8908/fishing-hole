<p>Absolutely—asking the <strong>right questions</strong> during
exploratory data analysis (EDA) is key to uncovering
<strong>insights</strong> that are <strong>clear, relevant, and
impactful</strong> to your customer.</p>
<p>Here’s a comprehensive list organized by theme. Think of it as your
<strong>EDA checklist</strong>—your personal detective toolkit for
getting to know any dataset and telling a compelling story about it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="general-data-understanding">🧩 <strong>1. General Data
Understanding</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the shape of the dataset (rows, columns)?</li>
<li>What does each column represent? What is the unit, if any?</li>
<li>What are the data types (numerical, categorical, text, date)?</li>
<li>Is this structured (tabular), time series, or unstructured
(text/image) data?</li>
<li>What is the primary entity or observation unit (a person,
transaction, machine, etc.)?</li>
<li>Is there a target variable? What are we trying to predict,
understand, or optimize?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="data-quality">🔍 <strong>2. Data Quality</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Are there missing values? How many per column?
<ul>
<li>Are they random, patterned, or systemic?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there duplicate rows?</li>
<li>Are there constant or near-constant columns?</li>
<li>Are there unexpected values (e.g., negative ages, future dates,
special characters)?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="descriptive-statistics-distributions">📏 <strong>3. Descriptive
Statistics &amp; Distributions</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>What are the min, max, mean, median, std, skewness, and kurtosis for
each numerical variable?</li>
<li>Are distributions normal, skewed, or multimodal?
<ul>
<li>Are there extreme outliers? Are they errors or legitimate?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do any variables have large variance or a wide range?</li>
<li>Which values appear most frequently (mode)?</li>
<li>Do any numerical columns show heavy-tailed distributions?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="categorical-variables">📊 <strong>4. Categorical
Variables</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>How many unique values are there per categorical column?</li>
<li>What is the frequency of each category? Are any dominant?</li>
<li>Are any categories rare or have too few occurrences?</li>
<li>Are categories cleanly formatted (e.g., consistent
spelling/casing)?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="time-based-questions-if-applicable">⏳ <strong>5. Time-Based
Questions (if applicable)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the time range of the data?</li>
<li>Are there gaps or bursts in time?</li>
<li>Are there temporal trends or seasonality?</li>
<li>Are key metrics stable or changing over time?</li>
<li>Is there a timestamp granularity issue (e.g., all dates the same,
only daily resolution)?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="relationships-between-variables">🧮 <strong>6. Relationships
Between Variables</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Which variables are strongly correlated (positively or
negatively)?</li>
<li>Are there multicollinear features (i.e., redundant
information)?</li>
<li>Are there interesting interactions between features (e.g., only when
A and B happen together)?</li>
<li>Are there group-level differences (e.g., average metric by
category)?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="feature-engineering-opportunities">🧠 <strong>7. Feature
Engineering Opportunities</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Are there columns that can be combined (e.g., year + month)?</li>
<li>Can you create ratios, flags, or aggregates?</li>
<li>Are there temporal features to extract (e.g., day of week,
hour)?</li>
<li>Can you bucket or bin continuous variables (e.g., age groups, price
bands)?</li>
<li>Can you encode hierarchical or ordinal relationships?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="target-variable-exploration-if-supervised-task">🧼 <strong>8.
Target Variable Exploration (if supervised task)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the target balanced or imbalanced?</li>
<li>How is the target variable distributed across key features?</li>
<li>Are there data leakage risks (features that “cheat” by knowing the
future)?</li>
<li>How does the target evolve over time or by group?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="anomalies-red-flags">🚩 <strong>9. Anomalies &amp; Red
Flags</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Are there clusters of missing data for certain rows/groups?</li>
<li>Are there inconsistent relationships (e.g., younger person with high
pension)?</li>
<li>Are there suspicious timestamp patterns (e.g., all events logged at
the same second)?</li>
<li>Are there duplicated IDs, names, or transaction numbers?</li>
<li>Do repeated exact values suggest automation, human error, or sensor
defaults?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="communicating-to-the-customer">📣 <strong>10. Communicating to
the Customer</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>What trends or insights matter most to the customer’s domain?</li>
<li>How does each insight tie back to the business problem or goal?</li>
<li>Can you offer a possible explanation or hypothesis for each
insight?</li>
<li>What decisions could be influenced by these insights?</li>
<li>Where should further data collection or deeper analysis happen?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="bonus-your-narrative-template-for-each-variable">✨ Bonus: Your
Narrative Template for Each Variable</h2>
<p>For each important column, answer: 1. <strong>What does this variable
measure, and why does it matter?</strong> 2. <strong>How is it
distributed?</strong> 3. <strong>What is typical (mean/median), and what
is unusual (outliers)?</strong> 4. <strong>How does it relate to the
target or other variables?</strong> 5. <strong>What should the customer
know or do about it?</strong></p>
<hr />

card or Markdown template for reuse in your reports or projects?</p>

<p>A. Understanding the Business Problem How do I translate a vague
business problem into actionable data questions?</p>
<p>What techniques help uncover the underlying goal behind a business
request?</p>
<p>Can you show me how to break down a business question into measurable
objectives and hypotheses?</p>
<p>B. Mapping Data to Questions How do I identify which tables and
columns in a data dictionary are relevant to a question?</p>
<p>Can you show me examples of matching business questions to variables
in real datasets?</p>
<p>What should I look for in a data dictionary to determine data quality
and coverage?</p>
<p>How do I recognize which variables need transformation or engineering
to be useful?</p>
<p>C. Designing the Analysis Plan What questions should I ask myself to
choose between descriptive, inferential, and predictive analysis?</p>
<p>How do I decide which types of charts or models best answer each kind
of business question?</p>
<p>What are best practices for structuring an analysis plan from
question to visual?</p>
<p>Can you walk me through how to select an appropriate modeling
technique for different data types?</p>
<p>How do I account for confounding variables and bias when designing an
analysis?</p>
<p>D. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) What are the key
components of EDA I should always include?</p>
<p>How do I tailor EDA based on the goal of the analysis?</p>
<p>Can you explain how to derive insights from EDA charts rather than
just describing them?</p>
<p>How do I combine data exploration with storytelling for
decision-makers?</p>
<p>E. Communicating Insights to Stakeholders How do I write an executive
summary that reflects the results of a data analysis plan?</p>
<p>What’s the difference between an analysis plan for a technical
vs. non-technical audience?</p>
<p>How can I explain complex findings clearly using analogies or visual
metaphors?</p>
<p>Can you provide examples of before-and-after improvements in how data
is communicated?</p>
<p>F. Practicing with Real Examples Can you give me practice case
studies where I have to write the analysis plan myself?</p>
<p>Can we work through one question at a time, and you critique and
improve my analysis plan?</p>
<p>What are examples of strong vs. weak analysis plans, and how can I
learn from them?</p>
<p>Can you walk me through famous or public data case studies and
reverse-engineer their analysis plan?</p>
<p>G. Automation and Repeatability How can I develop a reusable
checklist or template for building analysis plans?</p>
<p>Can you help me build a prompt template that lets me quickly create
these plans using ChatGPT?</p>
<p>How can I use LLMs or Python scripts to semi-automate the creation of
an EDA or analysis outline?</p>

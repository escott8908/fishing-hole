Such insights into the shape of a relationship (whether steady,

<h2 id="how-pdps-work-holding-other-factors-constant">How PDPs Work
(Holding Other Factors Constant)</h2>
<p>PDPs achieve their “all else equal” view by averaging out the
influence of all other features. Conceptually, to create a partial
dependence plot for one feature, you <strong>vary that feature’s
value</strong> through its range and see how the outcome changes on
average:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Select a feature and values:</strong> Pick the feature of
interest (e.g., <em>shipping distance</em>) and define a set of values
spanning its range (from low to high).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Fix the feature and predict:</strong> For each chosen value,
temporarily set <strong>all records</strong> in the data to have that
feature value, and use your model (or analysis) to predict the outcome
for every record with this fixed setting.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Average the outcome:</strong> Take the
<strong>average</strong> of all those predicted outcomes. This gives the
typical outcome when the feature is held at that specific value (with
other variables effectively constant).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Plot the results:</strong> Plot the feature’s value on the
x-axis against the average predicted outcome on the y-axis. Connecting
these points yields the PDP curve, showing how changes in the feature
alone would change the outcome (<a
href="https://medium.com/@kumar9059300448/partial-dependence-plots-f1464ce66f1a#:~:text=METHODOLOGY%3A">Partial
Dependence Plots. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a… | by Sai Kumar
Varanasi | Medium</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>This process creates a clear chart of the feature’s isolated effect.
Essentially, the PDP is telling us: <em>“On average, when this feature
is X, the outcome is Y”</em> – repeating that for many values to draw a
profile of the relationship. By averaging over other factors, PDPs strip
away noise from confounding variables. This means that even if in real
data many factors move together, the PDP can single out one factor’s
contribution. It’s a bit like running a controlled experiment on your
data: change one thing and see the result. The end result is an
<strong>intuitive curve</strong> that analysts can read to understand
the feature’s impact without other influences in the mix.</p>
<h2 id="d-vs.-2d-partial-dependence-plots">1D vs. 2D Partial Dependence
Plots</h2>
<p>PDPs come in two flavors, depending on how many features you examine
at once:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1D PDP (One-Dimensional):</strong> This plot shows how a
<strong>single feature</strong> affects the outcome when all others are
held constant (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). It’s usually a simple line graph. The feature’s values (e.g.,
distance in miles) run along the x-axis, and the y-axis shows the
model’s predicted outcome (e.g., delivery time) for those feature
values. A 1D PDP makes it easy to see the trend — whether the outcome
rises, falls, or has bends as the feature increases. For instance, a 1D
PDP could show how increasing <em>shipment distance</em> gradually
increases <em>delivery time</em>, tracing a clear curve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2D PDP (Two-Dimensional):</strong> This plot examines
<strong>two features together</strong> and their joint effect on the
outcome (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). It’s often visualized as a surface or heatmap instead of a
single line. One feature might be on the x-axis (e.g., distance) and the
second on the y-axis (e.g., shipment weight or size), with the outcome
represented by color intensity or contour lines. A 2D PDP reveals
<strong>interaction effects</strong> – situations where the impact of
one feature depends on the value of another (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). For example, a 2D plot might show that for short distances,
increasing shipment weight has a mild cost impact, but for very long
distances, heavy shipments drive the cost <strong>sharply</strong>
higher. Such a plot surfaces patterns that wouldn’t appear in a
one-feature-at-a-time view.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <strong>1D PDPs</strong> give a focused view of one
factor’s influence, and <strong>2D PDPs</strong> let us explore how two
factors combine to affect outcomes. If the two features do not interact,
the 2D PDP will look like a simple additive effect; but if there is an
interaction, the 2D plot will highlight regions where outcomes change in
a way that one feature alone couldn’t explain. This helps analysts
pinpoint not only individual drivers but also synergy or interference
between drivers in complex data.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-pdps-valuable-for-supply-chain-analysis">Why Are PDPs
Valuable for Supply Chain Analysis?</h2>
<p>Supply chain data is often <strong>complex</strong>, with many
interdependent factors (distance, time, cost, supplier ratings, demand
levels, etc.) influencing outcomes. PDPs are especially valuable in this
context because they help analysts untangle these factors and gain
clearer insights during exploratory data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolate Each Factor’s Impact:</strong> PDPs allow supply
chain analysts to focus on one factor at a time and see its true effect
on outcomes without other variables clouding the picture (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=Partial%20Dependence%20Plots%20work%20by,making%20and%20%2024">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). For example, you can examine how <em>lead time</em> alone
affects on-time delivery rates, factoring out other influences. This
isolation builds confidence about which drivers really matter and
how.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Visualize Trends and Thresholds:</strong> By charting the
relationship, PDPs make it easy to spot <strong>trends, patterns, or
thresholds</strong> in feature effects. You can tell if a relationship
is roughly linear or if it changes behavior at certain points (<a
href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html#:~:text=The%20partial%20dependence%20plot%20,a%20linear%20regression%20model%2C%20partial">19 
Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) – Interpretable Machine Learning</a>). For
instance, a PDP might show that increasing a warehouse’s inventory up to
a certain level sharply improves order fulfillment rate, but beyond that
level the benefit tapers off – revealing a saturation point. Such
intuitive visuals help in understanding and communicating where
diminishing returns or critical cut-offs lie.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Reveal Interactions Between Factors:</strong> Supply chain
outcomes often involve <strong>interactions</strong> (one factor’s
effect depends on another). A 2D PDP can uncover these. Perhaps <em>high
demand</em> only causes delays when <em>inventory is low</em> – an
interaction effect. By looking at two features together, analysts can
identify combinations that lead to bottlenecks or high costs, which
wouldn’t be obvious from isolated analysis (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). Catching these interactions is key to optimizing complex
processes (for example, knowing that <em>distance</em> and <em>shipping
mode</em> together determine if a delivery will be late).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Support:</strong> PDPs turn raw
model/data output into a form that decision-makers can easily interpret.
They answer “What if” questions with concrete visuals. In supply chain
management, companies use PDP insights to guide decisions – for example,
understanding how changes in <strong>demand or supply variables affect
overall efficiency and inventory needs</strong> (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,quality%2C%20helping%20to%20implement%20improvements">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). By seeing the effect of raising demand forecasts or adjusting
safety stock levels on outcomes like service level or cost, managers can
make more informed choices. Likewise, in manufacturing, PDPs have been
used to analyze how altering a process or using higher-quality materials
would impact <strong>product defect rates</strong> (<a
href="https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=logistics%20and%20inventory%20decisions.%20,quality%2C%20helping%20to%20implement%20improvements">❓
What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of
use.</a>). This kind of insight is extremely valuable for continuous
improvement and risk management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, PDPs have been highlighted as useful by researchers and
analysts in supply chain contexts. For example, one study pointed out
that business analysts at a manufacturer might want to know <em>“how
changes in their supply chain affect defect rates,”</em> which is
exactly the type of question PDPs help to explore. By providing a clear
view of cause-and-effect within complex supply chain systems, PDPs
enhance the exploratory analysis process, helping analysts validate
assumptions and discover new patterns hidden in the data.</p>
<h2 id="practical-examples-in-supply-chain">Practical Examples in Supply
Chain</h2>
<p>Let’s consider a few concrete examples of how PDPs can uncover
insights in supply chain data. These scenarios assume we have a
predictive model or analysis for the outcome of interest, and we use
PDPs to interpret the relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shipment Distance vs. Delivery Time:</strong> Imagine we
have data on shipments and their delivery times. A 1D PDP for
<strong>shipping distance</strong> would show how <em>delivery time</em>
is expected to change as distance increases, with all other factors
(like shipping method, weather, etc.) averaged out. We might see a
steadily rising curve – confirming that longer distances generally lead
to longer delivery times on average. For example, the PDP could tell us
that increasing a route from 100 to 500 miles adds a few extra days of
transit time (on average). This isolated view quantifies the intuitive
idea that “farther shipments take longer,” and it might reveal whether
the relationship is proportional or if, say, beyond a certain distance
the delivery time doesn’t increase as much (perhaps because air freight
is used for extremely long distances, leveling off the curve). Supply
chain planners can use this insight to <strong>predict delays</strong>
and manage customer expectations based on shipment distance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supplier Quality vs. Defect Rate:</strong> Consider a
manufacturing supply chain where each supplier has a quality rating, and
we track the <em>defect rate</em> (percentage of products with defects)
from each supplier’s shipments. A PDP for <strong>supplier quality
score</strong> would illustrate how the defect rate changes as the
quality rating improves, holding other factors (like shipment size or
distance) constant. We might observe, for instance, that as supplier
quality moves from a score of 6 to 8 (out of 10), the defect rate drops
significantly (meaning far fewer defective parts), but improving from 8
to 10 yields a smaller additional improvement. This tells us two things:
better supplier quality clearly leads to fewer defects, and there may be
<strong>diminishing returns</strong> – once quality is very high, other
factors might limit further reduction in defects. Such a plot helps
procurement and quality teams decide how much emphasis to put on
supplier development or screening. It provides a data-backed, visual
confirmation that <em>“higher supplier quality means lower
defects,”</em> and pinpoints roughly how much improvement in defects to
expect from a given improvement in quality score.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distance and Shipment Size vs. Shipping Cost (2D
PDP):</strong> In logistics, <strong>shipping cost</strong> is
influenced by multiple factors. Suppose we want to examine how both
<em>distance</em> and <em>shipment size/weight</em> together affect
cost. A 2D PDP could be generated with distance on one axis and shipment
weight on the other, and color shading to represent the predicted
shipping cost. This 2D plot might show, for example, that for
short-distance shipments, increasing the weight from light to heavy
causes a moderate rise in cost, whereas for long-distance shipments, the
same increase in weight causes a <strong>steep jump</strong> in cost. In
other words, the plot could reveal an interaction: distance amplifies
the effect of weight on cost. Perhaps shipping something heavy over a
very long route triggers a surcharge or requires a more expensive mode
of transport, resulting in disproportionately higher costs. By examining
this PDP, a logistics manager might conclude that <em>“when planning
long-haul shipments, keeping weight down yields especially big
savings,”</em> whereas for short hauls weight is less critical to cost.
This kind of insight, drawn from the combined effect of two features,
can guide strategic decisions like how to <strong>allocate heavy
products to nearer distribution centers</strong> or when to split a
shipment into smaller batches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these examples demonstrates how PDPs turn raw data
relationships into an understandable story. They help supply chain
professionals answer specific questions: <em>How much does distance
matter for delivery timing? In what way does supplier quality impact
defects? What’s the joint effect of distance and size on cost?</em> By
providing clear, focused views of these relationships, PDPs enhance
exploratory data analysis, allowing experts to derive actionable
insights from complex supply chain datasets without getting lost in the
weeds of multivariate interactions.</p>

Sequential Rule Mining in Supply Chain Data</h1>
<p><strong>Sequential rule mining</strong> is a data-mining technique
for finding time-ordered patterns in sequences of events. In simple
terms, we look at logs of events (like steps in an order fulfillment
process, maintenance actions, or customer purchases) and discover rules
about which events tend to come next. For example, a rule might say “if
action <strong>A</strong> happens, then action <strong>B</strong> often
follows.” Unlike standard association rules (which ignore order),
sequential rules <strong>require</strong> that events occur in a
specific sequence over time. In supply chain data, a “sequence” could be
the chain of events around an order or shipment – for instance:
<em>Inventory arrives → Production starts → Quality check → Goods
shipped</em>. We treat each sequence as an ordered list of events (just
like a shopping trip is a sequence of items bought).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support and confidence:</strong> Each sequential rule has
measures of how common or reliable it is. <em>Support</em> counts how
many sequences show the pattern (e.g. in how many orders we saw A
followed by B). <em>Confidence</em> is like a percentage chance: out of
all sequences where <strong>A</strong> happened, the fraction where
<strong>B</strong> followed. For example, confidence of 75% means “when
A occurred, B followed three-quarters of the time.” These measures help
us judge which rules are strong or noteworthy in our data.</li>
</ul>
<p> In a retail context, sequential rule mining is akin to analyzing a
shopping trip. For instance, if a customer buys bread and later comes
back for milk, the sequence is <em>bread → milk</em>. A rule might
capture “bread → milk” if it happens frequently. Similarly, in a supply
chain sequence you might see <em>order placed → item shipped</em>. The
rule would indicate that once an order is placed, an item is shipped
soon after.</p>
<h2 id="association-rules-vs.-sequential-rules">Association Rules
vs. Sequential Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Association rule mining</strong> (like market-basket
analysis) looks for items that occur together in <strong>no particular
order</strong>. For example, “bread and milk are often bought together.”
It treats each transaction (shopping cart) as a <strong>set</strong> of
items, ignoring the time or order in which they happened.</li>
<li><strong>Sequential rule mining</strong> looks for patterns across
<strong>time-ordered events</strong>. It only counts a pattern if one
event happens <em>before</em> the other. In other words, the order
matters. One blog explains this clearly: <em>“Sequential rules are found
in sequences, whereas association rules are found in records with no
ordering. In association rules, time order is not considered”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key difference:</em> Association rules ignore sequence (no time);
sequential rules insist on a sequence or timeline. In supply chain
terms, association rules might tell you “orders and returns often happen
together” (no sequence), whereas sequential rules might reveal “when an
order is placed (Event A), a shipment usually occurs next (Event
B)”.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-sequences-events-time">Key Components: Sequences,
Events, Time</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequence:</strong> An ordered list of events (sometimes
grouped into steps). For example, an order’s lifecycle:
<code>[Order Received] → [Stock Checked] → [Packed] → [Shipped]</code>.
Each “→” indicates the next step in time. As one resource puts it,
<em>“a sequence is an ordered list of sets of items”</em> – meaning we
track events in the order they happened.</li>
<li><strong>Events (Items/Actions):</strong> Individual steps or actions
in the sequence. In supply chain data, events could be things like
“invoice generated,” “parts received,” “machine maintenance,” or
“inventory replenished.” Each event is typically timestamped.</li>
<li><strong>Time Order:</strong> The core idea of sequential mining is
that events are inherently ordered by time (or by some logical order).
The rule mining algorithm looks at <em>what happens before and
after</em> within each sequence. For example, it distinguishes “Put on
packaging” then “Ship” from the reverse order.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components are structured so that each sequence (like a
customer journey or a process flow) is a list of events with time. We
mine across many such sequences to find common patterns. For example,
imagine hundreds of order records, each with timestamps for “Order,”
“Pack,” “Ship.” A sequential rule mining algorithm might find that “Pack
→ Ship” occurs in 80% of sequences where “Pack” appears, meaning packing
is usually followed by shipping.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-sequential-rules-in-exploratory-analysis">Why Use
Sequential Rules in Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Sequential rule mining is valuable for exploratory data analysis
because it <strong>uncovers hidden process patterns</strong> without
needing a preset model. In supply chain analytics, this helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reveal process flows and bottlenecks.</strong> You might
discover that after a certain event (like <em>Quality Check</em>), a
<em>Second Inspection</em> often follows with high confidence. This
hints at a common sub-process.</li>
<li><strong>Understand cause-effect patterns.</strong> By seeing which
actions typically come next, you can hypothesize about dependencies
(e.g., seeing that “Inventory Low” → “Reorder Sent” occurs 90% of the
time suggests a threshold for reordering).</li>
<li><strong>Monitor compliance and exceptions.</strong> If most
sequences follow a certain pattern, outliers stand out. For example, if
99% of shipment sequences go “Load Truck → Dispatch,” then any sequence
missing these steps is noteworthy.</li>
<li><strong>Generate actionable insights.</strong> You might learn that
when an urgent supplier delay (Event A) happens, it is often followed by
extra overtime shifts (Event B). Knowing this rule can help plan
staffing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, sequential rules let you <em>explore</em> the data and ask
“What typically happens next?” rather than making predictions. They
provide a summary of <em>common sequences</em> and the likelihood of
transitions. This is very useful in early-stage analysis (EDA) when
you’re trying to understand process behaviors and relationships over
time.</p>
<h2 id="practical-examples-in-supply-chain-context">Practical Examples
in Supply Chain Context</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supplier and Order Flows:</strong> Suppose your data logs
each step of order processing. Sequential mining might find a rule like
<em>“Order Received → Payment Processed → Inventory Checked”</em>. For
example, you might discover that <em>in 90% of orders</em>, payment
processing happens after the order and before inventory is checked. This
reveals the typical workflow of order handling.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Based Reordering:</strong> Imagine analyzing inventory
events. A sequential rule might be <em>“Stock Level Low → Reorder Placed
→ Goods Received”</em>. This tells you that when stock falls below a
threshold, a reorder is placed and followed by receiving goods. You
could quantify how reliably this process happens.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance and Repair Steps:</strong> For machine
maintenance logs, a rule might read <em>“Error Detected → Technician
Assigned → Repair Completed”</em>. Perhaps it finds that whenever an
error event occurs, 80% of the time a repair is completed within two
days. This shows the usual fix sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Fulfillment and Delivery:</strong> In a warehouse, events
might include <em>“Item Picked → Item Packed → Item Shipped”</em>.
Sequential rule mining could confirm that this three-step flow happens
in almost every order, and maybe quantify variations (e.g. “Pickup done
→ Packing skipped → Shipped” is rare).</li>
</ul>
<p>In a shipping/port context, sequential rules might capture flows like
“Container Unloaded → Customs Cleared → Delivered to Warehouse.” For
example, if you have timestamps for each checkpoint, a rule <em>“Unload
→ Customs”</em> with high confidence means unloading is almost always
followed by customs clearance. Such patterns help visualize the
end-to-end supply process.</p>
<p>Each of these examples can be phrased as an “if-then” rule, such as
“if <em>order placed</em> happens, then <em>shipment dispatched</em>
usually follows” (perhaps within a day or two). In a sequence-mining
algorithm, you might even set a time window (like “within 3 days”) to
refine which events count as following each other, but the concept
remains that of events in order.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-sequential-rules">Interpreting Sequential
Rules</h2>
<p>Sequential rules are interpreted much like natural language “if-then”
statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Rule:</strong> <em>“If event A happens, then
event B tends to follow.”</em> For instance, a rule might be “If
<em>Order_Shipped</em> occurs, then <em>Order_Delivered</em> follows.”
This means in many sequences, shipping is followed by delivery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support:</strong> Tells how common the sequence is. A
support of 50 means 50 orders had A followed by B.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confidence:</strong> Tells how reliable the rule is. A
confidence of 80% for “A → B” means that out of all sequences with A,
80% also had B later. In practice, we interpret this as “B follows A
most of the time.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a rule <em>A → B (confidence 80%)</em> means “when we
saw A, B occurred after it in 80% of cases.” If we say “Order_Approved →
Goods_Picked (75% confidence),” it suggests that three out of four times
after approval, goods picking happened next. We do <strong>not</strong>
assume 100% prediction accuracy – it’s exploratory. But it highlights a
strong pattern.</p>
<p>Remember, sequential rules are descriptive: they <strong>summarize
what the data shows about event order</strong>. They do not “force” that
B must always follow A, just that it usually does in your dataset. This
helps a data scientist understand relationships across time, spot common
workflows, and perhaps identify unusual cases where the expected
sequence breaks down.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Sequential rule mining finds patterns
like “A then B” in time-ordered data. For a supply chain data scientist,
this means uncovering typical chains of events (with measures of how
often they occur), which helps in exploring and understanding processes
such as ordering, logistics, maintenance, and fulfillment over time.</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Sequential rule mining has been
well-studied in data mining literature. It extends association rules by
requiring an order of events. The ideas of support (frequency) and
confidence (conditional probability) come from these definitions.
Examples and explanations above are adapted to illustrate how these
concepts apply to supply-chain event data.</p>

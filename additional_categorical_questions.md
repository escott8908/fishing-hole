These are all excellent and deeply insightful questions! Let’s walk through each one carefully — covering:

1. ✅ **How to calculate the chi-squared test for imbalance with one categorical variable**  
2. ✅ **What the “imbalance score” means and how it’s calculated**  
3. ✅ **How to measure “skew” in a categorical variable**

---

## ✅ 1. **Chi-Squared Test for Imbalance (Single Categorical Variable)**

### 🧠 Goal:
You want to test whether the observed distribution of a categorical variable is **uniform** (all categories equally likely) vs. **non-uniform** (some categories over- or under-represented).

### 🧪 Null Hypothesis \( H_0 \):
> The categories are **evenly distributed** (i.e., there's no preference or imbalance).

---

### 📊 Example:
Suppose you have a variable `job` with the following counts:

```python
value_counts = {
    "blue-collar": 9732,
    "management": 9458,
    "technician": 7597,
    "admin.": 5171,
    "services": 4154,
    "retired": 2264,
    "self-employed": 1579,
    "entrepreneur": 1487,
    "unemployed": 1303,
    "housemaid": 1240,
    "student": 938,
    "unknown": 288
}
```

### 🧮 Step-by-Step in Python:

```python
from scipy.stats import chisquare

# Step 1: Get observed values
observed = list(value_counts.values())

# Step 2: Create expected values assuming uniform distribution
n_categories = len(observed)
n_total = sum(observed)
expected = [n_total / n_categories] * n_categories

# Step 3: Run chi-squared test
chi2_stat, p_value = chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected)

print(f"Chi-squared: {chi2_stat:.2f}, p-value: {p_value:.5f}")
```

### ✅ Interpretation:
- **Low p-value (e.g., < 0.05)**: reject \( H_0 \), the distribution is **imbalanced**.
- **High p-value**: accept \( H_0 \), the distribution is likely **uniform**.

---

## ✅ 2. **What Is the “Imbalance Score”?**

The **imbalance score** is a **custom heuristic** (not a standard statistic) used to **quantify how unevenly the categories are distributed** — useful in EDA and modeling contexts.

### 💡 One common formula:

\[
\text{Imbalance Score} = 1 - \frac{H_{\text{normalized}}}{\log_2(k)}
\]

Where:
- \( H \) is the **Shannon entropy** of the distribution.
- \( k \) is the number of categories.
- This score ranges from **0 (perfectly uniform)** to **1 (maximally imbalanced)**.

### 🧮 In Python:

```python
import numpy as np

counts = np.array(list(value_counts.values()))
probs = counts / counts.sum()

entropy = -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs))
max_entropy = np.log2(len(probs))

imbalance_score = 1 - (entropy / max_entropy)
print(f"Imbalance Score: {imbalance_score:.4f}")
```

✅ Lower scores → more even distribution.  
✅ Higher scores → few categories dominate.

---

## ✅ 3. **How to Measure “Skew” in Categorical Features**

Numerical skewness doesn’t apply directly, but **categorical skew** can be interpreted in terms of **frequency dominance**:

### 🧠 You’re asking:
> "How lopsided is the distribution of categories?"

### 📌 Practical ways to measure or visualize this:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Top category proportion** | How much does the most frequent category dominate? (e.g., 40%) |
| **Entropy** | Measures uncertainty. High entropy → evenly spread, low entropy → skewed. |
| **Pareto chart** | Visualize how quickly category frequencies drop off. |
| **Imbalance score** | See above — quantifies how far the distribution is from uniform. |

### 📊 Visualization:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.countplot(x='job', data=df, order=df['job'].value_counts().index)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title("Categorical Skew in 'job'")
```

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Concept              | Use |
|----------------------|-----|
| **Chi-squared test** | Statistically test if the distribution is imbalanced |
| **Imbalance score**  | Quantify how uneven the category distribution is |
| **Categorical skew** | Assess dominance by top category, entropy, or visually via countplots |

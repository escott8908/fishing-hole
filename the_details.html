the right questions. Let’s turn your strength in identifying

<p>Take any variable you’ve analyzed. Now answer: 1. What is its
<strong>mean</strong>, <strong>std</strong>, and
<strong>distribution</strong>? 2. What could those values mean in the
context of <strong>operations, risk, or outcomes</strong>? 3. What
<strong>questions</strong> should you ask the customer about this
variable? 4. What <strong>decisions</strong> could this influence?</p>
<p>Would you like to try this on one of the variables you’ve already
explored (like <code>Air_System_Pressure</code>), and I can walk you

<p>“As <code>[X]</code> increases, <code>[Y]</code> also increases. This
pattern suggests a dependency between the two. In the context of
<code>[domain]</code>, this may indicate <code>[interpretation]</code>,
which could impact <code>[decision or outcome]</code>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; “As coolant pressure increases, the
likelihood of equipment failure also rises. In a manufacturing context,
this could suggest that elevated pressure is either stressing the system
or is a byproduct of blocked flow. This insight can inform predictive
maintenance strategies.”</p>

don’t tell you the whole story, but they tell you <strong>where to
look</strong> and <strong>what questions to ask</strong>. Your role as

process</strong>? - Is the target <strong>rare, risky, or
expensive</strong>? - Are there <strong>groups where the outcome is more
likely</strong>? - Is the prediction task even <strong>feasible or

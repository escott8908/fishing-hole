# Uncovering Data Insights with SHAP Values in Supply Chain EDA

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in supply chain can involve complex datasets – from supplier metrics to delivery records – where we want to understand how different factors influence outcomes. **SHAP values** (which stands for *SHapley Additive exPlanations*) offer an intuitive, visual way to reveal these relationships. Below, we explain what SHAP values are and how they help uncover how variables relate to outcomes *and to each other*, using simple analogies and supply chain examples.

## What Are SHAP Values? (Game Theory Made Simple)

Think of a predictive analysis as a **team game**, where each **feature** (variable) is a player and the **outcome** (prediction or result) is the total points (or *payout*) of the game. SHAP values, based on a concept from **cooperative game theory**, tell us how to **fairly distribute the payout among the players (features)** ([17  Shapley Values – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#:~:text=A%20prediction%20can%20be%20explained,the%20%E2%80%9Cpayout%E2%80%9D%20among%20the%20features)). In other words, SHAP values determine how much each feature contributed to the outcome in a fair, additive way. 

For example, if we’re predicting delivery time for a package, features like distance, weather, and truck capacity are the “players” contributing to the prediction. SHAP ensures each factor gets its fair share of credit (or blame) for the delivery time – just as Shapley values fairly allocate payoff to each player in a game ([17  Shapley Values – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#:~:text=A%20prediction%20can%20be%20explained,the%20%E2%80%9Cpayout%E2%80%9D%20among%20the%20features)). This game analogy is powerful but we will keep the math behind the scenes. The key idea is that **each SHAP value represents the contribution of one variable to the prediction**, given all the variables working together.

**Why is this useful?** In supply chain EDA, we often ask: *“Which factors drive late deliveries?”* or *“What conditions lead to higher supplier performance scores?”* Traditional plots and correlations give some clues, but SHAP values go further. They break down an outcome **into a sum of contributions from each feature** ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=learning%20model,on%20the%20values%20of%20the)). This means we can see *how much* each factor pushed an outcome up or down, and in *which direction* (positive or negative effect) ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)). SHAP was originally a tool for explaining machine learning models, but you don’t need to be a coder – you can use SHAP results like advanced analytics for your data, highlighting patterns and relationships that might be hidden in raw tables.

## Revealing Feature Effects (Relationships and Influence)

One of the most appreciated abilities of SHAP is that it shows **both the magnitude and direction of a feature’s effect** on the outcome ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)). Unlike simple correlation, SHAP can tell you, for each feature: “How much did this feature influence the result, and did it push the result higher or lower?” ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)). For instance, suppose an analysis predicts the likelihood of a delivery **delay**. A SHAP value for the feature *“distance to customer”* might be +0.20 for a certain shipment, meaning the long distance increased the delay risk by 0.20 (on some scale), while the feature *“warehouse on-time rate”* might have a SHAP value of –0.10, meaning a reliable warehouse **decreased** the delay risk for that shipment. In this way, SHAP provides a nuanced view of **how variables relate to the outcome**:

- A **positive SHAP value** for a feature means that feature pushed the prediction *upward* (increasing the outcome). For example, a positive SHAP value for *“distance”* in a delivery time model indicates longer distance is contributing to longer delivery times (an upward effect on delay).
- A **negative SHAP value** means the feature dragged the prediction *downward* (reducing the outcome). For example, a negative SHAP value for *“high truck capacity”* might mean larger trucks *reduce* delivery time (downward effect on delay).
- The **size (magnitude)** of the SHAP value shows how strong that feature’s impact is. A larger absolute value means a bigger push on the outcome ([An Introduction to SHAP Values and Machine Learning Interpretability | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability#:~:text=SHAP%20values%20are%20based%20on,how%20strong%20the%20effect%20is)).

Crucially, SHAP values do this **for each individual data point** as well as overall. This helps in EDA by illuminating not just general trends, but also specific cases that might be outliers or special scenarios. It’s like having a lens that can zoom out to see broad patterns and zoom in to explain one particular event.

## Global and Local Explanations with SHAP

When exploring data, we might want **global insights** (overall patterns in the whole dataset) and **local insights** (explanations for individual instances). SHAP provides both:

- **Global SHAP (Overall Feature Influence):** This is an aggregate view of which variables are most important in general. By averaging the absolute contributions of each feature across all data points, we get a sense of which features matter most overall ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages)). For example, in a supplier performance analysis, SHAP might reveal that *“on-time delivery rate”* and *“quality score”* are the top factors influencing the overall supplier performance rating, whereas a feature like *“region”* might rank lower in influence. Global SHAP answers, *“What are the drivers of outcomes across all suppliers or shipments?”* Features with higher overall SHAP influence are the key players in the dataset ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages)).

- **Local SHAP (Single Instance Explanation):** This drills down into one specific instance (one order, one shipment, one product) to explain *why* it has the outcome it does. SHAP will attribute that single prediction’s difference from the average outcome to each feature. Essentially, it provides a per-instance “contribution list.” For example, suppose one particular supplier has a surprisingly low performance score. A local SHAP explanation might show that this supplier’s *“delivery delay history”* contributed +5 points (worsening the score), while their *“high product quality”* contributed –3 points (improving the score), and other factors added or subtracted smaller amounts. Summing these contributions would match the difference between an average supplier’s score and this supplier’s score ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)). In short, local SHAP tells a story for each case: which features drove the outcome up or down for *that specific case* ([Analytics Snippet - Feature Importance and the SHAP approach to machine learning models - Actuaries Digital](https://www.actuaries.digital/2019/06/18/analytics-snippet-feature-importance-and-the-shap-approach-to-machine-learning-models/#:~:text=The%20following%20chart%20uses%20SHAP,prediction%20higher%20for%20this%20observation)). It helps answer questions like, *“Why was this shipment delayed so much?”* or *“Why did this product return rate spike for this order?”*, in terms of feature contributions.

By combining global and local perspectives, SHAP aids EDA at multiple levels: you see broad trends (global) and you can validate them or explore exceptions (local) in a consistent framework. Next, we’ll look at some of the visual tools SHAP offers to make these insights even clearer.

## Visualizing SHAP Insights: Summary and Dependence Plots

SHAP values are often visualized to help data analysts *see* the patterns of feature influence. Two common visualizations are **summary plots** and **dependence plots**, which reveal different aspects of the data relationships:

- **SHAP Summary Plot (Beeswarm Plot):** This chart provides a comprehensive overview of how each feature affects the outcome across all observations. Each feature is listed on the y-axis, typically ordered by overall importance. Each point on a row is an individual data point’s SHAP value for that feature (so thousands of points may be plotted). Points are colored by the feature’s actual value (e.g. red might indicate a high value for that feature, blue a low value). The points spread out horizontally to show the distribution of SHAP values. **What do we learn?** We see not only which features are most influential (by the width of the spread), but also the **direction of influence**: for instance, if red points (high feature value) cluster on the right (positive SHAP side) and blue on the left (negative SHAP side), it means higher values of that feature drive the prediction up, and lower values drive it down ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions)). This is crucial for understanding the relationship. *Example:* Imagine a summary plot for a product return prediction model, where one feature is *“days to delivery”*. If we see blue dots (short delivery times) mostly have negative SHAP values (left side) and red dots (long delivery times) have positive SHAP values (right side), it tells us short delivery times tend to reduce return rates, while long delivery times increase the chance of returns. In essence, the summary (beeswarm) plot gives a color-coded scatter of effects for each feature, encapsulating a lot of information: feature importance, effect distribution, and correlation of feature value with outcome impact ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions)).

 ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/)) *Figure: An example SHAP **summary (beeswarm) plot** showing feature impacts on a model’s predictions. Each dot represents one data instance’s SHAP value for that feature (features listed vertically). Dots are colored by the feature’s value (blue=low, red=high). This visual reveals how features relate to the outcome: for example, for “% working class” (first row), blue points (low value) have positive SHAP (pushing the prediction up) while red points (high value) have negative SHAP (pushing it down), indicating that lower values of this feature lead to higher predictions, and vice versa ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions)). The spread of points shows the range of influence each feature has.* 

- **SHAP Dependence Plot:** While the summary plot gives an overview, a dependence plot zooms in on **one feature at a time** to show how changes in that feature value affect the outcome (through its SHAP value). It’s essentially a scatter plot: x-axis is the feature’s value, y-axis is the SHAP value for that feature (impact on prediction) for each data point. By looking at the shape of the scatter, we can see the relationship (e.g. linear, curved, threshold effects). Moreover, to capture **interactions** between features, these plots often color the points by another feature. For example, suppose in a supply chain model we look at a dependence plot for *“shipment distance”* vs its SHAP value on delivery delay. We might color the points by *“weather severity”*. This could reveal that for a given distance, the SHAP value (effect on delay) is higher when weather is bad (say, red points) and lower when weather is good (blue points). A vertical spread of points at a single distance value indicates other features are influencing the delay impact for that distance ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20vertical%20dispersion%20in%20SHAP,8)). In other words, if the points aren’t in a tight line, it suggests an interaction: some other factor is modifying the effect of distance. **Interpretation:** A dependence plot helps us see *how a feature’s impact on the outcome changes across its range and in context with another feature*. For instance, a dependence plot for *“product weight”* (x-axis) on its SHAP for shipping cost might show that beyond a certain weight, the cost impact grows steeply – but only for certain shipping methods (colored differently), indicating an interaction between weight and shipping method. This level of detail is extremely valuable in supply chain EDA: it uncovers conditional relationships (like “if distance is long *and* weather is bad, delays skyrocket”). 

In summary, **summary plots** give a multi-feature overview, and **dependence plots** give a focused lens on one feature’s relationship (often revealing interactions). Both are intuitive visuals: even without knowing the math behind SHAP, one can look at these plots and glean insights such as “Feature A tends to increase outcome when it’s high” or “Feature B has a bigger effect on outcome at certain ranges or when Feature C is X.”

 ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/)) *Figure: An example **global SHAP bar chart** ranking features by overall influence. Each bar represents the mean absolute SHAP value for a feature (average impact on the model’s output across all instances). Longer bars mean the feature has a larger average effect on the outcome ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages)). (In this example from a housing model, “% working class” and “number of rooms” are top influencers on house price.) Such a chart helps identify which factors are most significant overall in a supply chain context – for instance, a similar chart for supplier performance might show “on-time delivery rate” and “quality score” as top drivers.* 

*(The summary and dependence plots are often used for global interpretation, while a complementary visualization for local interpretation is the **waterfall or force plot** – these show a single prediction being composed from feature contributions. In a waterfall plot, we start from a baseline (such as average outcome) and add each feature’s SHAP value one by one, visualizing how we arrive at the final prediction ([waterfall plot — SHAP latest documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/api_examples/plots/waterfall.html#:~:text=Waterfall%20plots%20are%20designed%20to,model%20output%20for%20this%20prediction)). For example, a waterfall chart for a specific product’s demand prediction might start at the average demand and then show +20 due to a holiday sale event, –5 due to a high price, +3 due to a popular color, etc., ending up at that product’s predicted demand. This gives a clear picture of **why** a particular prediction is high or low in terms of feature effects.)*

## Practical Examples in Supply Chain

To make these concepts concrete, here are a few **supply-chain-specific scenarios** where SHAP values can enhance EDA by uncovering insights:

- **Supplier Performance Analysis:** Imagine you have a score for each supplier’s performance last quarter. By applying SHAP (using a model that predicts the performance score from various metrics), you find that **on-time delivery percentage** and **defect rate** have the largest global SHAP values – indicating these are the dominant factors across all suppliers. Locally, for a supplier with a low score, SHAP might show a big negative contribution from a **high defect rate** (hurting their score) and a small positive contribution from an excellent **communication rating** (helping slightly). This tells us at a glance which areas each supplier needs to improve. We also might notice an interaction: the effect of **order volume** on performance is negative overall, but not as bad if the **lead time** is very long (perhaps because suppliers adjust better on long lead times). SHAP helps disentangle such relationships.

- **Delivery Delays:** Consider a logistics dataset of shipments with a binary outcome: was the delivery late or on-time? Using SHAP to explain a model predicting delay, we uncover that **shipping distance** and **weather conditions** are major global factors for delays (distance has a large positive SHAP on delay risk, bad weather similarly). A SHAP summary plot might show most red points (long distances) on the right (increasing delay probability) ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions)). A dependence plot for distance, colored by weather, could reveal that distance really matters when weather is poor (points colored for bad weather have much higher SHAP values for the same distance than those with good weather). On a local level, for a specific delayed delivery, a waterfall chart might list: +15% due to distance, +10% due to storm, –5% due to extra driver experience, resulting in a high delay risk overall. These insights guide us to focus on **routes that are long *and* during bad weather** as high-risk for lateness, something we might miss with simpler analysis.

- **Product Return Rates:** Suppose we analyze which factors influence whether a delivered product gets returned by the customer. SHAP analysis might reveal globally that **delivery time**, **product quality rating**, and **customer location distance** are key drivers of returns. Perhaps fast deliveries (short times) strongly reduce return likelihood (negative SHAP values), while certain product categories (e.g., electronics) have positive SHAP values indicating higher return chances. A summary plot could show, for example, *“delivery days”* with blue (low days) on the left (negative SHAP) and red (many days) on the right (positive SHAP), confirming that quicker deliveries lead to fewer returns. We might also find interactions: the dependence plot for *“product price”* might show that expensive items only have higher return SHAP values when the **customer satisfaction score** is low – suggesting that high-price items are returned if customers are unhappy for other reasons. Armed with this knowledge, a supply chain manager might investigate why certain high-value products dissatisfy customers (perhaps leading to improvements). SHAP essentially shines a light on these nuanced patterns in the returns data.

## Conclusion

SHAP values transform complex model predictions into **human-interpretable insights**. By treating each variable as a player contributing to an outcome, SHAP provides a **fair, consistent measure of feature influence** ([An Introduction to SHAP Values and Machine Learning Interpretability | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability#:~:text=SHAP%20,contribution%20to%20the%20model%27s%20output)) ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)). For professionals analyzing supply chain data, SHAP offers a powerful addition to the EDA toolbox: it not only ranks which factors matter, but also **explains the relationship** each factor has with the outcome (direction and strength), and even how factors interact with each other. The result is a deeper, intuitive understanding of your supply chain dataset. You can pinpoint why certain events (like a delivery delay or a spike in returns) happen and identify general drivers (like a supplier’s on-time rate) of key performance metrics. All of this is done in a clear, visual manner without resorting to heavy math – making SHAP an accessible yet insightful technique for anyone with data literacy to **discover data-driven stories** in supply chain operations.

**Sources:** The concept of SHAP originates from Lloyd Shapley’s game theory method for fair credit allocation ([17  Shapley Values – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#:~:text=A%20prediction%20can%20be%20explained,the%20%E2%80%9Cpayout%E2%80%9D%20among%20the%20features)). SHAP values have the desirable property of showing each feature’s contribution (positive or negative) to a prediction ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret)) and are consistent, additive explanations for model outputs ([An Introduction to SHAP Values and Machine Learning Interpretability | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability#:~:text=SHAP%20,contribution%20to%20the%20model%27s%20output)). They can be visualized in various ways to highlight global importance and feature effects ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=Beeswarm%20plots)) ([Explaining Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP Analyses](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20vertical%20dispersion%20in%20SHAP,8)), enabling detailed exploratory analysis as illustrated above. By applying SHAP in supply chain contexts (from forecasting demand ([SHAP Values In Support of Forecasting](https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=In%20the%20visualizations%20included%20in,This%20waterfall%20plot)) to diagnosing delays), analysts can gain both high-level and granular insights that drive better decisions.

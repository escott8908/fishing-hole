# Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plots: Revealing Hidden Patterns in Supply Chain Data

In supply chain analysis, understanding how factors like distance, shipment volume, or supplier characteristics affect outcomes (cost, delivery time, etc.) is crucial. Traditional charts often show **average** trends, but averages can hide important differences. **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots** offer a way to dig deeper and see *individual-level* patterns that are invisible in aggregate views. This section explains what ICE plots are, how they differ from Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), the idea of centered ICE plots (c-ICE), and why they are valuable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in supply chain contexts.

## What Are ICE Plots?

An ICE plot is a visualization that shows how changing one input factor **affects the predicted outcome for each individual data instance**, one instance at a time. In practical terms, imagine you have a predictive model or analysis for a supply chain outcome (say, shipping cost or delivery time). For a **single shipment or supplier**, you can ask: *“What would happen if I change this one factor (e.g. increase the distance or order size), while keeping everything else the same?”* An ICE plot answers this by drawing a line (curve) for each individual case, showing how that case’s predicted outcome would change as the feature of interest varies ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=Individual%20conditional%20expectation%20curves%20are,vary%20the%20feature%20of%20interest)). In other words, **each line in an ICE plot represents one shipment’s or one supplier’s “what-if” trajectory** when we tweak a single factor and hold others constant. By plotting many such lines (one per instance) together, we get a detailed, granular picture of how different instances behave.

This granular view makes ICE plots *intuitive to interpret*. You can literally see each instance’s response. If the lines are mostly overlapping or parallel, it means all instances respond similarly to that factor. If the lines diverge or have different shapes, it indicates that **different instances have different responses** – a sign of heterogeneity or interactions in the data ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=ICE%20curves%20can%20uncover%20heterogeneous,relationships)). For example, one shipment’s cost might rise sharply with increased distance, while another shipment’s cost might rise more gradually. ICE plots let us visualize these individual differences directly.

## ICE Plots vs. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)

**Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)** are a related tool, but they show only the *average effect* of a feature on the outcome across all instances. A PDP is essentially **one line that is the average of all the individual ICE lines** ([A Complete Guide to ICE Plots. ICE (Individual Conditional… | by Vikram Dev | Medium](https://easyml.medium.com/a-complete-guide-to-ice-plots-037c8e5ac9f1#:~:text=Link%20to%20Partial%20Dependence)). It tells you, for example, “on *average*, increasing shipping distance by 100 miles raises cost by X amount.” This is a useful high-level summary, but it **smooths out or hides any variability** among different shipments or suppliers ([A Complete Guide to ICE Plots. ICE (Individual Conditional… | by Vikram Dev | Medium](https://easyml.medium.com/a-complete-guide-to-ice-plots-037c8e5ac9f1#:~:text=Imagine%20an%20ICE%20plot%20where,in%20the%20individual%20ICE%20curves)). In contrast, an **ICE plot** displays *all those individual trajectories at once*, so you can see the spread and shape of each instance’s effect rather than just the mean ([4 model-agnostic interpretability techniques for complex models - The SAS Data Science Blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/07/model-agnostic-interpretability/#:~:text=PD%20plots%20focus%20on%20the,or%20observations%20in%20the%20data)).

To put it simply:

- **PDP (Average Effect):** Shows how the outcome changes with a feature *on average* across the entire dataset. It’s a single smooth curve representing the **global trend** ([4 model-agnostic interpretability techniques for complex models - The SAS Data Science Blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/07/model-agnostic-interpretability/#:~:text=PD%20plots%20focus%20on%20the,or%20observations%20in%20the%20data)). For instance, a PDP might show that increasing distance tends to increase delivery time in general.
- **ICE (Individual Effects):** Shows how the outcome changes with a feature for **each individual instance**. It draws one curve *per instance*, revealing the **varied, instance-specific trends** ([4 model-agnostic interpretability techniques for complex models - The SAS Data Science Blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/07/model-agnostic-interpretability/#:~:text=PD%20plots%20focus%20on%20the,or%20observations%20in%20the%20data)). For example, ICE could show one supplier’s delivery time increasing steeply with order size, while another supplier’s line stays flat (meaning that supplier’s delivery time is unaffected by order size).

Because the PDP is an average of the ICE curves, it can sometimes be misleading if different instances behave very differently. **ICE plots expose those differences.** By examining the bundle of ICE curves, we gain insight into how the same factor can have *different effects for different shipments or suppliers* ([4 model-agnostic interpretability techniques for complex models - The SAS Data Science Blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/07/model-agnostic-interpretability/#:~:text=PD%20plots%20focus%20on%20the,or%20observations%20in%20the%20data)). For instance, the PDP might show a moderate upward slope (implying “more volume = slightly more cost on average”), but the ICE plot might reveal that half the shipments actually incur a big cost jump with more volume while others see almost no change. The PDP’s single line would **mask this nuance**, whereas the ICE plot makes it obvious by showing multiple distinct lines.

## Centered ICE (c-ICE) Plots

One challenge with standard ICE plots is that each instance might start at a different baseline value. For example, if one shipment is initially very expensive and another is cheap, their ICE curves will be vertically far apart simply due to these starting differences. This can make it hard to compare the *shape* of the responses. **Centered ICE plots (c-ICE)** address this by aligning the curves to a common reference point. Essentially, we **“center” each individual’s curve at a chosen value of the feature (often the lowest or a median value)**, subtracting out the original prediction at that point ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20a%20problem%20with%20ICE,Each%20curve%20is%20defined%20as)) ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=The%20centered%20ICE%20plots%20make,point%20of%20the%20feature%20range)). After this centering, each line starts from the same baseline (often zero), and the plot shows only how much the prediction *changes relative to that baseline*.

What does this add? By removing the vertical offsets, **c-ICE plots make it easier to compare the *pattern* of each instance’s response** rather than their absolute values ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=The%20centered%20ICE%20plots%20make,point%20of%20the%20feature%20range)). You can more clearly see differences in the **slopes and shapes** of the curves. For example, in a c-ICE plot of distance vs. cost, two shipments may both start at zero (after centering), but one curve might climb steeply and another might climb slowly. This highlights that the first shipment’s cost is far more sensitive to distance than the second’s, without the distraction of their initial cost difference. In summary, **c-ICE plots help analysts spot nuances in how each instance’s outcome responds to a feature, by focusing on differences in behavior rather than differences in scale** ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=The%20centered%20ICE%20plots%20make,point%20of%20the%20feature%20range)).

## Why Use ICE Plots in Supply Chain EDA?

Supply chain datasets are often complex, with **each shipment, order, or supplier potentially behaving differently** due to a multitude of factors (product type, transport mode, region, etc.). During exploratory data analysis, we want to uncover these nuanced patterns and not be misled by aggregated views. ICE plots are extremely valuable in this context because they allow analysts to **zoom in on individual-level effects** and identify hidden structures in the data:

- **Revealing Hidden Heterogeneity:** ICE curves can **uncover heterogeneous relationships** that would be concealed by an average plot ([13  Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html#:~:text=ICE%20curves%20can%20uncover%20heterogeneous,relationships)). In a supply chain context, this means you can detect if a factor (like distance or lead time) affects certain shipments or suppliers *much differently* than others. This is critical for spotting subgroups or special cases – for example, perhaps shipments going by air show one pattern while those by sea show another. A PDP might only show a blended trend, but an ICE plot will clearly separate these patterns if they exist.
- **Identifying Interactions and Segments:** By observing the spread of ICE lines, you might notice that they cluster into distinct shapes. This suggests an **interaction** effect or a latent segment in your data. For instance, all the ICE lines for supplier A might behave one way (indicating one kind of response to increasing order volume), whereas supplier B’s lines behave differently. This insight could prompt you to investigate what other feature (like supplier capacity or transport mode) is causing the difference. In essence, ICE plots can hint at **“data segments” or conditional behaviors** that deserve further analysis.
- **Understanding Variability and Outliers:** ICE plots also help in recognizing outliers or unusual cases. If one line in the ICE plot is dramatically different from the rest, that signals an individual case that doesn’t follow the general rule. In supply chain management, such an outlier could be a particular route, product, or partner that needs special attention. Early in EDA, finding these exceptions can be very informative – it might reveal a data quality issue or a real-world exception (e.g. a certain lane where costs behave oddly).
- **Intuitive Communication:** Because each ICE line can be tied back to a real instance (a specific shipment or supplier), discussing the results can be more tangible. Instead of saying “on average, longer distances increase cost,” you can point to **actual examples**: *“See these curves? Shipments of fragile goods (the red lines) spike in cost after 500 km, whereas standard goods (blue lines) increase more steadily.”* This makes the data story concrete and accessible to stakeholders, grounding insights in real, individual cases rather than abstract averages.

In summary, ICE plots provide a **rich, nuanced view of feature effects**. They are particularly useful in exploratory analysis of supply chain data because they highlight how *each component of the supply chain may respond differently* to changes. This level of detail helps analysts ensure they aren’t overlooking important patterns that get lost in aggregation.

## Practical Examples in Supply Chain

To solidify the concept, let’s consider a couple of simple, supply-chain-focused scenarios where ICE plots can uncover valuable insights:

- **Shipping Distance vs. Cost:** Imagine a model that estimates shipping cost based on distance (among other factors). A Partial Dependence Plot might show a gentle upward slope, meaning *greater distance tends to increase cost on average*. However, an ICE plot could reveal multiple distinct behaviors. For example, shipments sent by **air** might have ICE curves that start high and rise steeply with distance (reflecting high per-mile costs), whereas shipments sent by **sea freight** might have curves that start lower and rise more slowly (perhaps a flat rate for long distances). There might even be some curves that plateau – for instance, if a route beyond a certain distance switches to a cheaper transport mode. By looking at the ICE plot, an analyst can immediately see these different clusters of cost behavior. This insight might lead to investigating the **transport mode** or cargo type as a key interacting factor, or to adjusting pricing strategies for long-haul versus short-haul shipments. The **average** trend alone would not show these nuances – it would only suggest a smooth cost increase – but the ICE plot makes the **different cost-response patterns** clear at the individual shipment level.

- **Supplier Lead Time vs. Order Volume:** Consider analyzing how increasing an order’s size (volume or quantity) affects delivery lead time from different suppliers. A PDP might indicate that larger orders slightly increase lead time overall. Yet an ICE plot for each supplier could tell a more detailed story. Perhaps **Supplier X** has a flat ICE curve – meaning whether you order 100 units or 1,000 units, their delivery time stays roughly the same (they have capacity to handle bigger orders without delay). Meanwhile, **Supplier Y** might have an ICE curve that shoots upward beyond a certain order size – maybe after 500 units, their lead time jumps by several days due to capacity constraints or batching processes. There could even be a **Supplier Z** whose ICE curve is non-monotonic – for small increases in order size they see a big delay (perhaps needing an extra shipment), but for very large orders they consolidate shipping and the marginal delay decreases. All these individual patterns would be evident on the ICE plot, showing each supplier’s unique response to order volume changes. This level of insight is invaluable: it helps supply chain managers tailor order strategies for each supplier (for example, knowing the volume threshold to stay below for Supplier Y to avoid delays). Such patterns would be **hidden in an average plot**, but ICE brings them to light.

Through these examples, it’s clear how ICE plots enable a deeper **instance-by-instance exploration**. They help answer questions like “*Do all shipments react the same way to this factor, or are there groups that behave differently?*” and “*Is there a tipping point where a particular supplier’s performance changes?*”. In complex supply chain data, where variability is high, ICE plots act as a magnifying glass to see the fine details of how each part of the system responds to changes. Using ICE plots in EDA thus enhances our ability to identify insightful patterns and make well-informed decisions based on those nuanced observations.

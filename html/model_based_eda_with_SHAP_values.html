Data Insights with SHAP Values in Supply Chain EDA</h1>
<p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> in supply chain can
involve complex datasets – from supplier metrics to delivery records –
where we want to understand how different factors influence outcomes.
<strong>SHAP values</strong> (which stands for <em>SHapley Additive
exPlanations</em>) offer an intuitive, visual way to reveal these
relationships. Below, we explain what SHAP values are and how they help
uncover how variables relate to outcomes <em>and to each other</em>,
using simple analogies and supply chain examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-shap-values-game-theory-made-simple">What Are SHAP
Values? (Game Theory Made Simple)</h2>
<p>Think of a predictive analysis as a <strong>team game</strong>, where
each <strong>feature</strong> (variable) is a player and the
<strong>outcome</strong> (prediction or result) is the total points (or
<em>payout</em>) of the game. SHAP values, based on a concept from
<strong>cooperative game theory</strong>, tell us how to <strong>fairly
distribute the payout among the players (features)</strong> (<a
href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#:~:text=A%20prediction%20can%20be%20explained,the%20%E2%80%9Cpayout%E2%80%9D%20among%20the%20features">17 
Shapley Values – Interpretable Machine Learning</a>). In other words,
SHAP values determine how much each feature contributed to the outcome
in a fair, additive way.</p>
<p>For example, if we’re predicting delivery time for a package,
features like distance, weather, and truck capacity are the “players”
contributing to the prediction. SHAP ensures each factor gets its fair
share of credit (or blame) for the delivery time – just as Shapley
values fairly allocate payoff to each player in a game (<a
href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#:~:text=A%20prediction%20can%20be%20explained,the%20%E2%80%9Cpayout%E2%80%9D%20among%20the%20features">17 
Shapley Values – Interpretable Machine Learning</a>). This game analogy
is powerful but we will keep the math behind the scenes. The key idea is
that <strong>each SHAP value represents the contribution of one variable
to the prediction</strong>, given all the variables working
together.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this useful?</strong> In supply chain EDA, we often
ask: <em>“Which factors drive late deliveries?”</em> or <em>“What
conditions lead to higher supplier performance scores?”</em> Traditional
plots and correlations give some clues, but SHAP values go further. They
break down an outcome <strong>into a sum of contributions from each
feature</strong> (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=learning%20model,on%20the%20values%20of%20the">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). This means we can see <em>how much</em> each factor
pushed an outcome up or down, and in <em>which direction</em> (positive
or negative effect) (<a
href="https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret">SHAP
Values In Support of Forecasting</a>). SHAP was originally a tool for
explaining machine learning models, but you don’t need to be a coder –
you can use SHAP results like advanced analytics for your data,
highlighting patterns and relationships that might be hidden in raw
tables.</p>
<h2 id="revealing-feature-effects-relationships-and-influence">Revealing
Feature Effects (Relationships and Influence)</h2>
<p>One of the most appreciated abilities of SHAP is that it shows
<strong>both the magnitude and direction of a feature’s effect</strong>
on the outcome (<a
href="https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret">SHAP
Values In Support of Forecasting</a>). Unlike simple correlation, SHAP
can tell you, for each feature: “How much did this feature influence the
result, and did it push the result higher or lower?” (<a
href="https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret">SHAP
Values In Support of Forecasting</a>). For instance, suppose an analysis
predicts the likelihood of a delivery <strong>delay</strong>. A SHAP
value for the feature <em>“distance to customer”</em> might be +0.20 for
a certain shipment, meaning the long distance increased the delay risk
by 0.20 (on some scale), while the feature <em>“warehouse on-time
rate”</em> might have a SHAP value of –0.10, meaning a reliable
warehouse <strong>decreased</strong> the delay risk for that shipment.
In this way, SHAP provides a nuanced view of <strong>how variables
relate to the outcome</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>positive SHAP value</strong> for a feature means that
feature pushed the prediction <em>upward</em> (increasing the outcome).
For example, a positive SHAP value for <em>“distance”</em> in a delivery
time model indicates longer distance is contributing to longer delivery
times (an upward effect on delay).</li>
<li>A <strong>negative SHAP value</strong> means the feature dragged the
prediction <em>downward</em> (reducing the outcome). For example, a
negative SHAP value for <em>“high truck capacity”</em> might mean larger
trucks <em>reduce</em> delivery time (downward effect on delay).</li>
<li>The <strong>size (magnitude)</strong> of the SHAP value shows how
strong that feature’s impact is. A larger absolute value means a bigger
push on the outcome (<a
href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability#:~:text=SHAP%20values%20are%20based%20on,how%20strong%20the%20effect%20is">An
Introduction to SHAP Values and Machine Learning Interpretability |
DataCamp</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, SHAP values do this <strong>for each individual data
point</strong> as well as overall. This helps in EDA by illuminating not
just general trends, but also specific cases that might be outliers or
special scenarios. It’s like having a lens that can zoom out to see
broad patterns and zoom in to explain one particular event.</p>
<h2 id="global-and-local-explanations-with-shap">Global and Local
Explanations with SHAP</h2>
<p>When exploring data, we might want <strong>global insights</strong>
(overall patterns in the whole dataset) and <strong>local
insights</strong> (explanations for individual instances). SHAP provides
both:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Global SHAP (Overall Feature Influence):</strong> This is
an aggregate view of which variables are most important in general. By
averaging the absolute contributions of each feature across all data
points, we get a sense of which features matter most overall (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). For example, in a supplier performance analysis, SHAP
might reveal that <em>“on-time delivery rate”</em> and <em>“quality
score”</em> are the top factors influencing the overall supplier
performance rating, whereas a feature like <em>“region”</em> might rank
lower in influence. Global SHAP answers, <em>“What are the drivers of
outcomes across all suppliers or shipments?”</em> Features with higher
overall SHAP influence are the key players in the dataset (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local SHAP (Single Instance Explanation):</strong> This
drills down into one specific instance (one order, one shipment, one
product) to explain <em>why</em> it has the outcome it does. SHAP will
attribute that single prediction’s difference from the average outcome
to each feature. Essentially, it provides a per-instance “contribution
list.” For example, suppose one particular supplier has a surprisingly
low performance score. A local SHAP explanation might show that this
supplier’s <em>“delivery delay history”</em> contributed +5 points
(worsening the score), while their <em>“high product quality”</em>
contributed –3 points (improving the score), and other factors added or
subtracted smaller amounts. Summing these contributions would match the
difference between an average supplier’s score and this supplier’s score
(<a
href="https://inpher.io/blog/shap-values/#:~:text=A%20characteristic%20and%20widely%20appreciated,are%20relatively%20easy%20to%20interpret">SHAP
Values In Support of Forecasting</a>). In short, local SHAP tells a
story for each case: which features drove the outcome up or down for
<em>that specific case</em> (<a
href="https://www.actuaries.digital/2019/06/18/analytics-snippet-feature-importance-and-the-shap-approach-to-machine-learning-models/#:~:text=The%20following%20chart%20uses%20SHAP,prediction%20higher%20for%20this%20observation">Analytics
Snippet - Feature Importance and the SHAP approach to machine learning
models - Actuaries Digital</a>). It helps answer questions like,
<em>“Why was this shipment delayed so much?”</em> or <em>“Why did this
product return rate spike for this order?”</em>, in terms of feature
contributions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By combining global and local perspectives, SHAP aids EDA at multiple
levels: you see broad trends (global) and you can validate them or
explore exceptions (local) in a consistent framework. Next, we’ll look
at some of the visual tools SHAP offers to make these insights even
clearer.</p>
<h2
id="visualizing-shap-insights-summary-and-dependence-plots">Visualizing
SHAP Insights: Summary and Dependence Plots</h2>
<p>SHAP values are often visualized to help data analysts <em>see</em>
the patterns of feature influence. Two common visualizations are
<strong>summary plots</strong> and <strong>dependence plots</strong>,
which reveal different aspects of the data relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHAP Summary Plot (Beeswarm Plot):</strong> This chart
provides a comprehensive overview of how each feature affects the
outcome across all observations. Each feature is listed on the y-axis,
typically ordered by overall importance. Each point on a row is an
individual data point’s SHAP value for that feature (so thousands of
points may be plotted). Points are colored by the feature’s actual value
(e.g. red might indicate a high value for that feature, blue a low
value). The points spread out horizontally to show the distribution of
SHAP values. <strong>What do we learn?</strong> We see not only which
features are most influential (by the width of the spread), but also the
<strong>direction of influence</strong>: for instance, if red points
(high feature value) cluster on the right (positive SHAP side) and blue
on the left (negative SHAP side), it means higher values of that feature
drive the prediction up, and lower values drive it down (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). This is crucial for understanding the relationship.
<em>Example:</em> Imagine a summary plot for a product return prediction
model, where one feature is <em>“days to delivery”</em>. If we see blue
dots (short delivery times) mostly have negative SHAP values (left side)
and red dots (long delivery times) have positive SHAP values (right
side), it tells us short delivery times tend to reduce return rates,
while long delivery times increase the chance of returns. In essence,
the summary (beeswarm) plot gives a color-coded scatter of effects for
each feature, encapsulating a lot of information: feature importance,
effect distribution, and correlation of feature value with outcome
impact (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions">Explaining

Analyses</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a

Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>) <em>Figure: An example SHAP <strong>summary (beeswarm)
plot</strong> showing feature impacts on a model’s predictions. Each dot
represents one data instance’s SHAP value for that feature (features
listed vertically). Dots are colored by the feature’s value (blue=low,
red=high). This visual reveals how features relate to the outcome: for
example, for “% working class” (first row), blue points (low value) have
positive SHAP (pushing the prediction up) while red points (high value)
have negative SHAP (pushing it down), indicating that lower values of
this feature lead to higher predictions, and vice versa (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). The spread of points shows the range of influence each
feature has.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHAP Dependence Plot:</strong> While the summary plot gives
an overview, a dependence plot zooms in on <strong>one feature at a
time</strong> to show how changes in that feature value affect the
outcome (through its SHAP value). It’s essentially a scatter plot:
x-axis is the feature’s value, y-axis is the SHAP value for that feature
(impact on prediction) for each data point. By looking at the shape of
the scatter, we can see the relationship (e.g. linear, curved, threshold
effects). Moreover, to capture <strong>interactions</strong> between
features, these plots often color the points by another feature. For
example, suppose in a supply chain model we look at a dependence plot
for <em>“shipment distance”</em> vs its SHAP value on delivery delay. We
might color the points by <em>“weather severity”</em>. This could reveal
that for a given distance, the SHAP value (effect on delay) is higher
when weather is bad (say, red points) and lower when weather is good
(blue points). A vertical spread of points at a single distance value
indicates other features are influencing the delay impact for that
distance (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20vertical%20dispersion%20in%20SHAP,8">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). In other words, if the points aren’t in a tight line, it
suggests an interaction: some other factor is modifying the effect of
distance. <strong>Interpretation:</strong> A dependence plot helps us
see <em>how a feature’s impact on the outcome changes across its range
and in context with another feature</em>. For instance, a dependence
plot for <em>“product weight”</em> (x-axis) on its SHAP for shipping
cost might show that beyond a certain weight, the cost impact grows
steeply – but only for certain shipping methods (colored differently),
indicating an interaction between weight and shipping method. This level
of detail is extremely valuable in supply chain EDA: it uncovers
conditional relationships (like “if distance is long <em>and</em>
weather is bad, delays skyrocket”).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <strong>summary plots</strong> give a multi-feature
overview, and <strong>dependence plots</strong> give a focused lens on
one feature’s relationship (often revealing interactions). Both are
intuitive visuals: even without knowing the math behind SHAP, one can
look at these plots and glean insights such as “Feature A tends to
increase outcome when it’s high” or “Feature B has a bigger effect on
outcome at certain ranges or when Feature C is X.”</p>

Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>) <em>Figure: An example <strong>global SHAP bar
chart</strong> ranking features by overall influence. Each bar
represents the mean absolute SHAP value for a feature (average impact on
the model’s output across all instances). Longer bars mean the feature

href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20starting%20point%20for,but%20have%20two%20key%20advantages">Explaining

and “number of rooms” are top influencers on house price.) Such a chart
helps identify which factors are most significant overall in a supply
chain context – for instance, a similar chart for supplier performance
might show “on-time delivery rate” and “quality score” as top
drivers.</em></p>
<p><em>(The summary and dependence plots are often used for global
interpretation, while a complementary visualization for local
interpretation is the <strong>waterfall or force plot</strong> – these
show a single prediction being composed from feature contributions. In a
waterfall plot, we start from a baseline (such as average outcome) and
add each feature’s SHAP value one by one, visualizing how we arrive at
the final prediction (<a
href="https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/api_examples/plots/waterfall.html#:~:text=Waterfall%20plots%20are%20designed%20to,model%20output%20for%20this%20prediction">waterfall
plot — SHAP latest documentation</a>). For example, a waterfall chart
for a specific product’s demand prediction might start at the average
demand and then show +20 due to a holiday sale event, –5 due to a high
price, +3 due to a popular color, etc., ending up at that product’s
predicted demand. This gives a clear picture of <strong>why</strong> a
particular prediction is high or low in terms of feature
effects.)</em></p>
<h2 id="practical-examples-in-supply-chain">Practical Examples in Supply
Chain</h2>
<p>To make these concepts concrete, here are a few
<strong>supply-chain-specific scenarios</strong> where SHAP values can
enhance EDA by uncovering insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Supplier Performance Analysis:</strong> Imagine you have
a score for each supplier’s performance last quarter. By applying SHAP
(using a model that predicts the performance score from various
metrics), you find that <strong>on-time delivery percentage</strong> and
<strong>defect rate</strong> have the largest global SHAP values –
indicating these are the dominant factors across all suppliers. Locally,
for a supplier with a low score, SHAP might show a big negative
contribution from a <strong>high defect rate</strong> (hurting their
score) and a small positive contribution from an excellent
<strong>communication rating</strong> (helping slightly). This tells us
at a glance which areas each supplier needs to improve. We also might
notice an interaction: the effect of <strong>order volume</strong> on
performance is negative overall, but not as bad if the <strong>lead
time</strong> is very long (perhaps because suppliers adjust better on
long lead times). SHAP helps disentangle such relationships.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delivery Delays:</strong> Consider a logistics dataset of
shipments with a binary outcome: was the delivery late or on-time? Using
SHAP to explain a model predicting delay, we uncover that
<strong>shipping distance</strong> and <strong>weather
conditions</strong> are major global factors for delays (distance has a
large positive SHAP on delay risk, bad weather similarly). A SHAP
summary plot might show most red points (long distances) on the right
(increasing delay probability) (<a
href="https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/a-non-technical-guide-to-interpreting-shap-analyses/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that,to%20higher%20house%20price%20predictions">Explaining
Machine Learning Models: A Non-Technical Guide to Interpreting SHAP
Analyses</a>). A dependence plot for distance, colored by weather, could
reveal that distance really matters when weather is poor (points colored
for bad weather have much higher SHAP values for the same distance than
those with good weather). On a local level, for a specific delayed
delivery, a waterfall chart might list: +15% due to distance, +10% due
to storm, –5% due to extra driver experience, resulting in a high delay
risk overall. These insights guide us to focus on <strong>routes that
are long <em>and</em> during bad weather</strong> as high-risk for
lateness, something we might miss with simpler analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product Return Rates:</strong> Suppose we analyze which
factors influence whether a delivered product gets returned by the
customer. SHAP analysis might reveal globally that <strong>delivery
time</strong>, <strong>product quality rating</strong>, and
<strong>customer location distance</strong> are key drivers of returns.
Perhaps fast deliveries (short times) strongly reduce return likelihood
(negative SHAP values), while certain product categories (e.g.,
electronics) have positive SHAP values indicating higher return chances.
A summary plot could show, for example, <em>“delivery days”</em> with
blue (low days) on the left (negative SHAP) and red (many days) on the
right (positive SHAP), confirming that quicker deliveries lead to fewer
returns. We might also find interactions: the dependence plot for
<em>“product price”</em> might show that expensive items only have
higher return SHAP values when the <strong>customer satisfaction
score</strong> is low – suggesting that high-price items are returned if
customers are unhappy for other reasons. Armed with this knowledge, a
supply chain manager might investigate why certain high-value products
dissatisfy customers (perhaps leading to improvements). SHAP essentially
shines a light on these nuanced patterns in the returns data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>SHAP values transform complex model predictions into
<strong>human-interpretable insights</strong>. By treating each variable
as a player contributing to an outcome, SHAP provides a <strong>fair,
consistent measure of feature influence</strong> (<a

supply chain data, SHAP offers a powerful addition to the EDA toolbox:
it not only ranks which factors matter, but also <strong>explains the
relationship</strong> each factor has with the outcome (direction and
strength), and even how factors interact with each other. The result is
a deeper, intuitive understanding of your supply chain dataset. You can
pinpoint why certain events (like a delivery delay or a spike in
returns) happen and identify general drivers (like a supplier’s on-time
rate) of key performance metrics. All of this is done in a clear, visual
manner without resorting to heavy math – making SHAP an accessible yet
insightful technique for anyone with data literacy to <strong>discover

<p>That’s a really insightful challenge to tackle! Bridging the gap
between data exploration and domain relevance is essential for making
your findings truly impactful. Here are some strategies to help you
relate your exploratory figures back to the project:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="start-with-the-problem-statement"><strong>1. Start with the
Problem Statement</strong></h3>
<p>Before you dive into the analysis, clearly define the problem you are
trying to solve or the question you are trying to answer. This will help
guide how you interpret your figures.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> “Identify factors contributing to
high patient readmission rates.”<br />
- <strong>Interpretation Approach:</strong> When looking at distribution
plots or correlations, frame your insights around how they relate to
readmission, like patient age or specific conditions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="tie-each-plot-to-a-specific-question"><strong>2. Tie Each Plot
to a Specific Question</strong></h3>
<p>Make sure each figure answers a specific question or hypothesis.
Instead of just generating plots, think about what you want to learn
from each.</p>
<p><strong>Example Questions:</strong><br />
- What patterns can I see in patient demographics related to
readmission?<br />
- Are there any unusual trends or correlations between medical
conditions and treatment outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Annotate your plots with text that explicitly
answers the question.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="use-the-so-what-test"><strong>3. Use the “So What?”
Test</strong></h3>
<p>Every time you generate a plot, ask yourself, <strong>“So what does
this mean for the project?”</strong><br />
- If the answer isn’t clear, reconsider why you made that plot in the
first place.<br />
- Frame your interpretation in terms of its <strong>business or
operational impact</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="summarize-with-a-sentence-or-two"><strong>4. Summarize with a
Sentence or Two</strong></h3>
<p>After each plot, write a brief summary that connects the result back
to the project’s goal. Use a simple format:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> What do you see?<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> Why does it matter?<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> What should be done?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>“The box plot shows that patients aged 65+ have significantly higher
readmission rates compared to younger patients. This suggests that age
may be a key factor in predicting readmission, and targeted
interventions could reduce hospital readmission in older
populations.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="use-comparisons-and-contrasts"><strong>5. Use Comparisons and
Contrasts</strong></h3>
<p>Humans naturally understand insights when they see comparisons.
Instead of just showing a single plot, compare multiple groups or trends
side by side.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Compare readmission rates between different treatment types or
hospital departments.<br />
- Contrast the distribution of vital signs between readmitted and
non-readmitted patients.</p>
<p><strong>Framing Statement:</strong><br />
<em>“While treatment A has a 20% higher readmission rate than treatment
B, age differences between treatment groups account for part of the
discrepancy, suggesting age-specific protocols may be
beneficial.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="contextualize-with-domain-knowledge"><strong>6. Contextualize
with Domain Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>If possible, bring in external knowledge or research to frame your
findings. This makes your interpretation sound more grounded and
authoritative.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>“These results align with prior studies showing that comorbid
conditions like diabetes significantly impact readmission rates. This
highlights the need for integrated care approaches.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="keep-your-audience-in-mind"><strong>7. Keep Your Audience in
Mind</strong></h3>
<p>Tailor your explanations to the expertise level of your
audience:<br />
- <strong>Technical Audience:</strong> Highlight methodology and data
integrity.<br />
- <strong>Non-Technical Audience:</strong> Focus on high-level takeaways
and actionable insights.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use storytelling techniques to build a
narrative that moves from data to insight to recommendation.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="use-insight-statements"><strong>8. Use “Insight
Statements”</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you present a figure, follow it up with an insight
statement:<br />
- <strong>Data Insight:</strong> “This scatter plot shows a positive
correlation between patient age and readmission probability.”<br />
- <strong>Business Insight:</strong> “This indicates that older patients
are at higher risk, suggesting a need for age-specific post-discharge
care plans.”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="practice-data-storytelling"><strong>9. Practice “Data
Storytelling”</strong></h3>
<p>Create a flow where one insight logically leads to the next, forming
a coherent narrative. This way, your audience doesn’t just see a series
of figures but understands the story they collectively tell.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="rehearse-verbally"><strong>10. Rehearse Verbally</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes writing the insight isn’t enough—practice saying it out
loud as if you were presenting. This helps clarify your thoughts and
make them more understandable.</p>

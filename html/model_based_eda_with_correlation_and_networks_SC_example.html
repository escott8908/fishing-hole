Correlation and Network Graphs in Supply Chain EDA</h1>
<p>Exploring complex supply chain datasets can feel like mapping a maze.
Two powerful mapping tools are <strong>feature correlation</strong> and
<strong>network graphs</strong>. Together, they help reveal hidden
patterns, relationships, and structures in your data – all without any
predictive modeling. Below, we break down what each concept means in
simple terms and show how combining them can enhance insight discovery
in exploratory data analysis (EDA) for supply chain data.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-feature-correlation">Understanding Feature
Correlation</h2>
<p><strong>Feature correlation</strong> tells us how strongly two
variables in a dataset move in relation to each other. In plain
language, it measures association: when one metric changes, does another
tend to change as well? Correlation is typically expressed with a
coefficient (often called <strong>r</strong>) ranging from -1 to +1 (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=,positive%20linear%20relationship%2C%20and%200">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). A <strong>positive correlation</strong> (r
near +1) means that as one feature increases, the other tends to
increase as well (they move “up or down in the same direction together”)
(<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=Positive%20correlation%3A%20A%20positive%20correlation,in%20the%20same%20direction%20together">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). A <strong>negative correlation</strong> (r
near -1) means that when one feature rises, the other tends to fall
(they move in opposite directions) (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=Positive%20correlation%3A%20A%20positive%20correlation,in%20the%20same%20direction%20together">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). And an <strong>r around 0</strong> means
changes in one feature don’t consistently relate to changes in the other
(no clear relationship) (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=Positive%20correlation%3A%20A%20positive%20correlation,in%20the%20same%20direction%20together">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). In short, a strong correlation (r value close
to ±1) implies that changes in one variable
<strong>consistently</strong> affect the other (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/correlation-in-logistics-supply-chain-7-stats#:~:text=A%20strong%20correlation%20,making">7
Stats: Correlation in Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Uncovered</a>),
whereas an r value near 0 suggests the two features vary
independently.</p>
<p>In supply chain analytics, correlation can uncover meaningful
patterns. For example, analysts have observed that <strong>average
delivery time</strong> and <strong>inventory levels</strong> often show
a significant negative correlation – as delivery times get shorter,
inventory can be run leaner without shortages (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/correlation-in-logistics-supply-chain-7-stats#:~:text=,holding%20excess%20inventory%20while%20ensuring">7
Stats: Correlation in Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Uncovered</a>).
Recognizing such a relationship helps operations managers understand
that improving one aspect (faster deliveries) is typically accompanied
by improvements in another (more efficient inventory use). It’s
important to remember that correlation itself doesn’t prove one thing
causes the other; it simply highlights a noteworthy association.
Nonetheless, these associations are invaluable for directing attention
to potential problem areas or confirming intuitive hunches with
data.</p>
<p><strong>Different types of feature correlations</strong> can be used
depending on the data type and the nature of the relationship. Each type
of correlation measure is like a different lens for examining how
features relate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pearson Correlation:</strong> This is the classic
correlation measure for numeric data. Pearson’s r measures the
<strong>linear relationship</strong> between two continuous variables
(<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=,positive%20linear%20relationship%2C%20and%200">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). If the relationship looks like a straight
line (e.g. shipping distance vs. fuel cost might increase in a roughly
linear fashion), Pearson is appropriate. It ranges from -1 (perfect
inverse linear relationship) to +1 (perfect positive linear
relationship), with 0 meaning no linear link (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=,positive%20linear%20relationship%2C%20and%200">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). Use Pearson when your supply chain metrics
are quantitative (like costs, times, quantities) and you suspect a
straight-line trend – for instance, <strong>transport distance and
delivery cost</strong> likely have a high Pearson correlation because
longer routes generally incur higher costs in a proportional
way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spearman Correlation:</strong> Spearman’s rank
correlation assesses the <strong>monotonic relationship</strong> between
two variables (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=,data%20is%20not%20normally%20distributed">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). In simpler terms, it looks at whether one
variable <strong>consistently increases or decreases</strong> as the
other one increases, not necessarily at a constant rate. It is computed
on the ranks of the data rather than the raw values, so it doesn’t
assume a linear relationship (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=,data%20is%20not%20normally%20distributed">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>). Spearman is useful if your data isn’t
normally distributed, has outliers, or if the relationship is non-linear
but one-directional (always up or always down). For example, in supply
chain data, <strong>supplier rating vs. defect rate</strong> might have
a monotonic relationship: as supplier quality ratings improve, defect
rates drop, though not in a perfectly straight line. Spearman would
capture this association even if the improvement slows down at higher
ratings. In short, use Spearman for <strong>ordinal data</strong> (like
ranked survey scores) or anytime you want to catch any steady
upward/downward trend between two variables, linear or not (<a
href="https://medium.com/@tilak559/understanding-correlation-pearson-spearman-and-more-b26c6e1d4420#:~:text=Choosing%20the%20right%20correlation%20metric,bridges%20binary%20and%20continuous%20data">Understanding
Correlation: Pearson, Spearman, and More | by Tilak Mudgal |
Medium</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cramér’s V:</strong> Pearson and Spearman work for
numeric data, but what about <strong>categorical features</strong>
(things like regions, product categories, or shipping methods)? This is
where Cramér’s V comes in. <strong>Cramér’s V</strong> measures the
strength of association between two categorical variables (<a
href="https://medium.com/@manindersingh120996/understanding-categorical-correlations-with-chi-square-test-and-cramers-v-a54fe153b1d6#:~:text=Cramer%E2%80%99sV%20correlation%20is%20used%20to,determined%20by%20the%20other%20attribute">Understanding
Categorical Correlations with Chi-Square Test and Cramer’s V | by
Maninder Singh | Medium</a>). Its value ranges from 0 (no association)
to 1 (perfect association) (<a
href="https://medium.com/@manindersingh120996/understanding-categorical-correlations-with-chi-square-test-and-cramers-v-a54fe153b1d6#:~:text=Cramer%E2%80%99sV%20correlation%20is%20used%20to,determined%20by%20the%20other%20attribute">Understanding
Categorical Correlations with Chi-Square Test and Cramer’s V | by
Maninder Singh | Medium</a>). An intuitive way to think of it: 0 means
knowing the category of one feature tells you nothing about the category
of the other, whereas 1 means one feature’s category completely
determines the other’s category (<a
href="https://medium.com/@manindersingh120996/understanding-categorical-correlations-with-chi-square-test-and-cramers-v-a54fe153b1d6#:~:text=Cramer%E2%80%99sV%20correlation%20is%20used%20to,determined%20by%20the%20other%20attribute">Understanding
Categorical Correlations with Chi-Square Test and Cramer’s V | by
Maninder Singh | Medium</a>). Use Cramér’s V when exploring questions
like “Is there a relationship between <strong>warehouse location and
delivery mode</strong>?” or “Do certain <strong>product categories ship
mostly via a specific transport method</strong>?” A high Cramér’s V
would indicate, for example, that certain regions are strongly linked to
a particular shipping mode (perhaps overseas orders are almost always by
air freight, whereas local deliveries are by truck). This coefficient
gives a clear, single number summary of how tightly two classifications
are linked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mutual Information:</strong> Mutual information (MI) is a
more general measure of association that comes from information theory.
It captures any kind of dependency between variables, not just linear or
monotonic relationships. In essence, <strong>mutual information measures
how much knowing one feature reduces uncertainty about the
other</strong> (<a
href="https://tungmphung.com/a-survey-of-correlation-analysis-methods/#:~:text=Mutual%20Information%20is%20a%20natural,and%20vice%20versa">A
survey of correlation analysis methods</a>). If two features share a lot
of information (meaning one is very informative about the other), their
mutual information score will be higher. Unlike correlation
coefficients, MI is non-negative (0 means no relationship, and higher
values indicate greater dependency; often it’s normalized to a 0-1 scale
for interpretability). MI is especially handy when dealing with complex,
non-linear relationships or when you have a mix of categorical and
numeric data. For instance, consider <strong>weather conditions and
shipment delays</strong>. This relationship might be non-linear –
perhaps normal weather has little effect, but severe storms cause a big
jump in delays. Pearson or Spearman might not capture this well, but
mutual information would detect that knowing the weather significantly
reduces uncertainty in predicting delays (because extreme weather is a
strong clue for late shipments). In supply chain EDA, you might use
mutual information to uncover hidden associations such as
<strong>combination patterns</strong> (e.g., which combinations of order
type and season affect return rates) or any situation where the
relationship isn’t simply “bigger X, bigger Y.” In summary, mutual
information is a flexible tool to identify <strong>any kind of
relationship</strong> – it tells you that two features have a link, even
if that link is nonlinear or complex (<a
href="https://medium.com/@suyebaanjum98/approaches-to-unearth-correlations-between-numeric-and-categorical-data-6b44f6cdb45#:~:text=2">“Approaches
to Unearth Correlations Between Numeric and Categorical Data” | by
Suyebaanjum | Medium</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing the appropriate type of correlation for your data
(Pearson for linear numeric trends, Spearman for rank-based trends,
Cramér’s V for categorical ties, MI for general dependencies), you can
explore your supply chain dataset from multiple angles (<a
href="https://medium.com/@tilak559/understanding-correlation-pearson-spearman-and-more-b26c6e1d4420#:~:text=Choosing%20the%20right%20correlation%20metric,bridges%20binary%20and%20continuous%20data">Understanding
Correlation: Pearson, Spearman, and More | by Tilak Mudgal |
Medium</a>). This helps ensure you don’t miss an important relationship
just because it didn’t show up under a single method.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-network-graphs">Understanding Network Graphs</h2>
<p>Once you’ve identified relationships through correlation (or other
means), the next step is often to <strong>visualize</strong> those
relationships. This is where <strong>network graphs</strong> come into
play. A network graph is basically a picture of connections:
<strong>nodes</strong> (points) represent entities and
<strong>edges</strong> (lines) represent the relationships or links
between those entities (<a
href="https://powerviz.ai/network-graph#:~:text=A%20Powerviz%20Network%20Graph%20is,directional%20arrow%2C%20and%20many%20more">Network
Graph - Powerviz</a>). In our context, each node could be a data feature
(a particular metric or variable in your dataset), and an edge between
two feature-nodes might indicate that those two features are related
(for example, an edge if their correlation is above a certain
threshold).</p>
<p>Think of a network graph as a city map: the nodes are like locations,
and the edges are roads connecting them. If there’s a road (edge)
between two locations (nodes), it means you can travel directly between
them – similarly, an edge between two features might mean they have a
strong association. No edge means little to no direct association. This
visual approach taps into our pattern-recognition ability, making it
easier to <strong>spot clusters and key connections</strong> at a glance
than by staring at a big spreadsheet of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Simple vs. Weighted Networks:</strong> In a <em>simple
(unweighted) network graph</em>, all edges are equal – a connection
either exists or it doesn’t (<a
href="https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/a-level/computer-science/what-s-the-difference-between-a-weighted-and-an-unweighted-graph#:~:text=A%20weighted%20graph%20assigns%20a,an%20unweighted%20graph%20does%20not">What’s
the difference between a weighted and an unweighted graph? |
TutorChase</a>). It’s like an on/off indicator of a relationship. For
example, you might draw a simple network where an edge is drawn only if
two features have a correlation above 0.5 (significant relationship) and
no edge if below that. This quickly shows which pairs are related at
all. By contrast, a <em>weighted network graph</em> assigns a
<strong>strength or weight</strong> to each connection (<a
href="https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/a-level/computer-science/what-s-the-difference-between-a-weighted-and-an-unweighted-graph#:~:text=A%20weighted%20graph%20assigns%20a,an%20unweighted%20graph%20does%20not">What’s
the difference between a weighted and an unweighted graph? |
TutorChase</a>) (<a
href="https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/a-level/computer-science/what-s-the-difference-between-a-weighted-and-an-unweighted-graph#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20a,one%20with%20the%20fewest%20edges">What’s
the difference between a weighted and an unweighted graph? |
TutorChase</a>). The weight could be the correlation coefficient itself
or some score representing relationship strength. In visualization, you
might show this by varying the <strong>thickness or color
intensity</strong> of the edges – a thicker line for a stronger
correlation, thinner for a weaker one. For instance, in a weighted
network of supply chain features, the link between <em>Distance</em> and
<em>Shipping Cost</em> might be drawn as a very thick line if their
correlation is 0.9, whereas the link between <em>Distance</em> and
<em>Product Category</em> (likely a much weaker relationship) might be a
very thin or even absent line. Weighted graphs convey not just
<strong>who is connected to whom</strong>, but <strong>how
strongly</strong> they are connected (<a
href="https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/a-level/computer-science/what-s-the-difference-between-a-weighted-and-an-unweighted-graph#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20a,one%20with%20the%20fewest%20edges">What’s
the difference between a weighted and an unweighted graph? |
TutorChase</a>).</p>
<p>Both types have their uses: an unweighted graph is great for clarity
– highlighting the presence of relationships and clustering of features
into groups – while a weighted graph adds nuance by indicating degrees
of connection. In many exploratory analyses, you might start simple (to
see the basic structure of relationships), then introduce weights for
deeper insight into which links are the most influential.</p>
<p>Notably, network graphs can also show <strong>positive vs. negative
relationships</strong> by using different colors or line styles for
edges. For example, a green solid line could represent a positive
correlation and a red dashed line a negative correlation. This way, the
graph can depict whether connected features move in the same or opposite
directions. All of these visual cues (presence/absence of edges,
thickness, color, etc.) help in translating raw data relationships into
an intuitive picture.</p>
<h2
id="visualizing-correlations-with-network-graphs-for-supply-chain-insights">Visualizing
Correlations with Network Graphs for Supply Chain Insights</h2>
<p>Combining feature correlation analysis with network graphs creates a
powerful synergy during EDA. The correlation analysis quantifies
<strong>pairwise relationships</strong> between supply chain variables,
and the network graph provides a <strong>visual map</strong> of these
relationships across the whole system (<a
href="https://www.metwarebio.com/correlation-network-graphs/#:~:text=Correlation%20network%20graphs%20are%20created,33%2C%20metabolomics%20%2B%20transcriptomics%2C%20etc">A
Comprehensive Guide to Correlation Network Graphs</a>). This combo
allows analysts and stakeholders to literally see the web of
interconnections, making complex data more approachable.</p>
<p>Why is this so valuable for supply chain data? Supply chain
operations involve many interdependent factors: lead times, shipping
costs, supplier ratings, demand forecasts, inventory levels, delivery
performance metrics, and so on. A change in one area often ripples
through others. By plotting these features as a network, you can
identify <strong>clusters of related features</strong> and key linkages
that might not be obvious from raw tables or standard charts.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we compute the correlations among a variety of
supply chain performance metrics. We might find a cluster of features
all strongly interlinked relating to <strong>supplier
performance</strong> – say, <em>On-Time Delivery Percentage</em>,
<em>Defect Rate</em>, and <em>Customer Satisfaction Score</em>. These
three could form a tightly knit trio in a network graph, indicating they
all correlate with each other (on-time delivery is high when defect
rates are low and customer satisfaction is high, and vice versa). This
cluster suggests an underlying theme (perhaps “supplier
reliability/quality”), and improving one of these metrics could be
associated with improvements in the others. In another part of the
network, we might see features like <em>Distance</em>, <em>Shipping
Cost</em>, <em>Order Size</em>, and <em>Lead Time</em> clustering
together. This could represent a <strong>logistics-related
group</strong> – long distances tend to drive up shipping costs and lead
times, and larger orders might also affect cost and time. By identifying
such clusters, a network graph effectively segments the dataset into
meaningful subsets (like quality-related metrics vs. logistics-related
metrics), which helps teams assign the right focus area or expert to
investigate further.</p>
<p>Now, consider what happens when these clusters are visualized
together. The network graph might reveal that some nodes act as bridges
between clusters. In our example, <em>On-Time Delivery</em> might
connect the supplier performance cluster and the logistics cluster, with
a <strong>negative correlation link</strong> to <em>Lead Time</em> and
<em>Distance</em>. This makes intuitive sense: as shipping distances and
lead times grow, on-time performance tends to suffer (fewer shipments
arrive as scheduled). Such a visualization highlights a
<strong>cross-domain insight</strong> – a logistics factor (distance) is
impacting a customer service metric (on-time delivery). This could
prompt a closer look into how distance is managed (maybe through
regional warehouses or optimized routing) to improve on-time rates.</p>
<p><em>An example network graph of supply chain features.</em> Each node
represents a metric (orange nodes for <em>supplier performance</em>
metrics, blue nodes for <em>logistics</em> metrics). An edge between two
nodes indicates a strong correlation or association. Here, green
<strong>solid</strong> lines denote <strong>positive
correlations</strong> (metrics that rise and fall together), and red
<strong>dashed</strong> lines denote <strong>negative
correlations</strong> (one metric rises while the other falls). You can
see two clusters: the orange cluster connects features like
<strong>On-Time Delivery</strong>, <strong>Defect Rate</strong>, and
<strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong> (these tend to all relate closely
to supplier reliability and quality), while the blue cluster links
<strong>Distance</strong>, <strong>Shipping Cost</strong>, <strong>Lead
Time</strong>, and <strong>Order Size</strong> (features associated with
logistics and operational flow). The <strong>On-Time Delivery</strong>
node sits at the intersection, connected by red dashed lines to
<em>Distance</em> and <em>Lead Time</em>. This indicates that longer
distances and lead times are associated with lower on-time delivery
performance – a critical insight for supply chain managers concerned
with delivery reliability. By visualizing the data this way, patterns
jump out: one can immediately spot, for instance, that improving
<em>On-Time Delivery</em> might involve tackling issues in the distance
and lead time domain, and that <em>Defect Rate</em> and <em>Customer
Satisfaction</em> are tightly intertwined (likely requiring joint
quality improvement initiatives). In short, the network graph turns the
correlation numbers into a map of how different supply chain factors
interrelate, making the data’s story clearer and more compelling (<a
href="https://www.metwarebio.com/correlation-network-graphs/#:~:text=Correlation%20network%20graphs%20are%20created,33%2C%20metabolomics%20%2B%20transcriptomics%2C%20etc">A
Comprehensive Guide to Correlation Network Graphs</a>).</p>
<p>Using network graphs in exploratory analysis encourages a
<strong>“big picture” view</strong>. Instead of analyzing correlations
one pair at a time in isolation, you see how all features connect
collectively. This holistic visualization can reveal surprising
structures. For example, you might discover a small group of features
that are <strong>all interconnected</strong> with each other but
relatively detached from the rest. In a supply chain context, perhaps a
set of metrics related to <em>warehouse operations</em> (like picking
time, packing accuracy, storage cost) correlate strongly with each other
forming a distinct module in the network. Recognizing that as a
self-contained cluster tells you these factors might be driven by a
common underlying element (such as warehouse efficiency or technology)
and could be managed or investigated together.</p>
<p>Another benefit is identifying <strong>potential key drivers or
hubs</strong>. In a correlation network, a node with many connections
(edges) could be an important variable that interacts with several
aspects of the business. For instance, suppose <em>Order Volume</em>
(number of orders) is connected moderately to a range of other nodes –
inventory levels, lead times, stockouts, transportation cost, etc. This
would show up as a hub in the network. It suggests that order volume is
a central factor in the supply chain system, touching many performance
areas. Such a node might warrant special attention: fluctuations in it
could send ripples throughout the network (which we see via the many
edges). Even though correlation doesn’t prove causation, seeing a hub
prompts us to consider whether that metric is a driving force or just a
common consequence. In EDA, that’s a cue for formulating hypotheses or
diving deeper into process analysis.</p>
<p>The combination of correlations and network graphs is also a powerful
communication tool. Supply chain data can be technical, and not everyone
on a decision-making team will be comfortable reading matrices of
correlation coefficients. A well-designed network graph, however, can be
shown in a meeting to quickly communicate relationships. For example, a
network graph could help explain to a procurement team that
<strong>“supplier on-time performance is closely linked not only with
defect rates, but also seems tied to how far goods are
traveling”</strong> – all in one visual. This often sparks productive
discussions: the team might ask <em>why</em> those links exist, leading
to exploration of underlying causes (perhaps distant suppliers are more
likely to be late due to longer transit and also might have quality fade
issues). In this way, the visualization isn’t just pretty; it directly
supports deeper understanding and cross-functional dialogue.</p>
<p>To sum up, <strong>feature correlation</strong> provides the
quantitative backbone for identifying which supply chain variables move
together, and <strong>network graphs</strong> provide the intuitive
visualization that brings those relationships to life. Using them
together during exploratory analysis helps analysts <strong>quickly spot
patterns and outliers</strong>, such as clusters of tightly related
metrics and lone variables that don’t correlate with others. It shines a
light on the data’s internal structure – for example, distinguishing
groups of features by theme (quality, cost, time, etc.) and revealing
linkages between these groups. This approach remains purely descriptive
(we’re not making predictions or assuming causal directions), which is
exactly the goal of EDA: to <strong>understand the data</strong> and
generate insights and hypotheses. In a complex field like supply chain
management, where everything is interconnected, seeing those connections
mapped out can be incredibly enlightening. It allows teams with strong
data literacy (but perhaps little background in machine learning or
statistics) to leverage their intuition and domain knowledge – once the
relationships are visualized, they can apply their expertise to
interpret why those patterns might be occurring and how they could be
addressed. Ultimately, feature correlations and network graphs together
turn raw supply chain data into a meaningful story of how different
pieces of the operation relate, helping practitioners make informed
decisions and explore “what-ifs” with greater confidence. (<a

Analysis: Uncovering Time-to-Event Insights in Supply Chain Data</h1>
<p>Survival analysis is a branch of statistics focused on
<strong>analyzing the time until an event occurs</strong> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=Survival%20analysis%20is%20a%20branch,at%20what%20rate%20will%20they">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). In simple terms, it helps us study how long
something lasts before a specified event happens. This could be a
negative event (like a shipment delay or a part failure) or a positive
event (like an on-time delivery milestone). Unlike basic statistics that
might only tell us whether an event happened or not, survival analysis
examines <strong>when</strong> events happen and how likely they are to
happen as time goes on. It originated in fields like medicine (time
until death or relapse) and engineering (time until machine failure,
known as reliability analysis in that context) (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=Survival%20analysis%20is%20a%20branch,at%20what%20rate%20will%20they">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>), but the same techniques can be applied to
supply chain data. Survival analysis attempts to answer practical
questions such as <em>“What proportion of items will
<strong>survive</strong> (remain event-free) past a certain time?”</em>
and <em>“At what rate do events occur over time?”</em> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=answer%20certain%20questions%2C%20such%20as,decrease%20the%20probability%20of%20survival">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). In a supply chain setting, these translate to
questions like: <em>What percentage of shipments remain on schedule
after each day in transit?</em> At what point in time do most delays or
failures tend to occur? And under what conditions or factors do delays
happen sooner or later? By tackling these questions, survival analysis
provides a powerful, time-oriented perspective on your data.</p>
<h2 id="time-until-an-event-and-event-probability-over-time">Time Until
an Event and Event Probability Over Time</h2>
<p>A core concept in survival analysis is the
<strong>“time-to-event”</strong> perspective. Instead of just counting
how many shipments experienced delays, we examine <strong>how long each
shipment went before a delay occurred</strong> (if it did at all). Every
shipment (or part, or process) in the data has a duration measured from
a start point (e.g. shipment dispatch) to either the event of interest
(e.g. a delay) or the end of observation. This focus on durations lets
us see the distribution of times at which events happen, uncovering
patterns such as whether delays usually crop up early in transit or only
after a long duration.</p>
<p>Hand-in-hand with time-to-event is the idea of <strong>event
probability over time</strong>. We often summarize this with a
<strong>survival function</strong>, usually denoted S(t). The survival
function S(t) gives the probability that the subject (e.g. a shipment)
has <strong>not</strong> yet experienced the event by time <em>t</em>
(<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262#:~:text=Survival%20data%20are%20generally%20described,The%20logrank%20test%20may%20be">Survival
Analysis Part I: Basic concepts and first analyses - PMC</a>). In other
words, S(t) is the chance a shipment is still on-time (delay-free) at
time <em>t</em>. At the very beginning (t = 0, dispatch time), S(0) is 1
(100% of shipments have had no delay at the start). As time progresses,
S(t) typically decreases, reflecting that more and more shipments
encounter delays as days go by. By looking at S(t), we get a full
picture of how risk accumulates over time rather than a single aggregate
probability. For example, S(5 days) might be 0.85, meaning 85% of
shipments have no delay by day 5 (15% have encountered a delay by then),
and S(10 days) might be 0.60, meaning 60% have no delay by day 10 (40%
have had a delay by that point).</p>
<p>Another way to express “probability of event occurrence over time” is
through the <strong>cumulative event probability</strong> (sometimes
called the cumulative incidence), which is just 1 – S(t). This
represents the probability that the event <strong>has</strong> occurred
by time <em>t</em>. For instance, if 40% of shipments have had a delay
by 10 days, the cumulative event probability at 10 days is 0.40.
Survival analysis allows us to plot and analyze these probabilities over
time, which is far more informative than a single overall delay rate. It
might show, for example, that delays are rare in the first 2 days (curve
stays high), but the probability shoots up after day 5 (curve drops more
steeply), indicating a critical time window where issues become much
more likely.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that survival analysis methods handle
<strong>censored data</strong>, which is very common in practice.
Censoring means some items never experience the event during the study
period, or the event hasn’t occurred <em>yet</em> when data collection
ends. In a supply chain example, perhaps some shipments never
encountered a delay (they arrived on time) or a machine hasn’t failed as
of the last observation. Instead of throwing these cases out, survival
analysis includes them in the analysis up until the point we stopped
observing. This way, <strong>incomplete information is still
used</strong>. We know, for example, that a particular shipment was
on-time for 7 days (observation period) and it never delayed in that
period – this still provides valuable insight that it “survived” at
least 7 days delay-free. Techniques like Kaplan-Meier estimation
(discussed next) account for such censored cases so that our
time-to-event insights remain unbiased.</p>
<h2 id="key-survival-analysis-methods">Key Survival Analysis
Methods</h2>
<p>Survival analysis provides several tools to describe and model
time-to-event data without heavy math. The most common methods include
visualizing survival curves and fitting models to explore factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Kaplan–Meier Survival Curves:</strong> The Kaplan-Meier
(KM) method is a non-parametric technique to estimate the survival
function from data (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262#:~:text=Survival%20data%20are%20generally%20described,The%20logrank%20test%20may%20be">Survival
Analysis Part I: Basic concepts and first analyses - PMC</a>). It
calculates the probability of surviving (no event) beyond each point in
time by observing when events occur in the data (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262#:~:text=Survival%20data%20are%20generally%20described,The%20logrank%20test%20may%20be">Survival
Analysis Part I: Basic concepts and first analyses - PMC</a>). The
result is often shown as a stepwise <strong>survival curve</strong> that
starts at 100% and drops downwards each time an event happens. The
curve’s y-axis shows the proportion of subjects still event-free
(on-time shipments, defect-free parts, etc.), and the x-axis is time. A
KM curve is intuitive to read: for any given time, you can see what
fraction of the group has not yet experienced the event. For example, a
KM curve for shipments might show that after 3 days, 95% of shipments
are still on-time, but after 10 days, only 60% remain on-time –
indicating when delays tend to materialize. Kaplan-Meier curves make no
assumptions about the underlying distribution of times; they purely
reflect the empirical data (including handling of censored cases). They
are great for exploratory analysis because you can <strong>compare
survival curves between different groups</strong> (e.g. one curve for
shipments via Route A vs. another for Route B) to see which group
experiences events sooner or at a higher rate. If the curves diverge,
it’s a clear visual sign of a difference in performance or risk between
those groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Survival Function (S(t)):</strong> As mentioned, the
survival function is the fundamental concept that Kaplan-Meier curves
display. It is simply the probability of surviving (no event) past a
given time (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262#:~:text=Survival%20data%20are%20generally%20described,The%20logrank%20test%20may%20be">Survival
Analysis Part I: Basic concepts and first analyses - PMC</a>). While not
a “method” per se (it’s a concept), it’s worth noting because in
practice analysts might talk about <strong>survival
probabilities</strong> at specific time points. For instance, you might
report, “The 1-month survival probability for a supplier’s parts is
0.92,” meaning 92% of parts had no failure within one month. You might
also look at <strong>median survival time</strong>, which is the time by
which 50% of subjects have experienced the event (and 50% have not). In
supply chain terms, if the median time to a shipment delay on a certain
route is 8 days, that tells you half the shipments encounter a delay by
day 8. The survival function can also be converted to an
<strong>expected time until event</strong> (the mean time to event),
though medians are often more robust when the distribution is skewed. In
exploratory analysis, simply examining the shape of the survival
function can reveal whether events tend to cluster early or late and
whether there’s a long tail of subjects that rarely experience the event
at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cox Proportional Hazards Model:</strong> While
Kaplan-Meier curves describe the survival experience of groups, the
<strong>Cox proportional hazards</strong> model (often just called
<strong>Cox regression</strong>) is a statistical model that lets us
assess the impact of multiple factors (variables) on the time to event
(<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=,116">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). It is a semiparametric model – meaning it
doesn’t assume a specific baseline distribution for event times, but it
does assume that the effect of each factor on the hazard (the
instantaneous risk of the event) is constant over time (that’s the
“proportional hazards” assumption). In simpler terms, a Cox model can
tell us which variables significantly speed up or delay the occurrence
of the event. For example, in a supply chain context, you might include
factors like shipping route, carrier, season, or product type in a Cox
model for time to delivery delay. The model could find that <em>Route B
has a hazard ratio of 2.0 compared to Route A</em>, meaning at any given
time, Route B shipments are about twice as likely to encounter a delay
as Route A shipments (so Route B experiences delays faster) (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=,116">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). Another example: a Cox model might reveal
that perishable goods have a 50% higher risk of spoilage at any point in
time than non-perishables under the same conditions. Importantly, Cox
regression adjusts for multiple factors at once – this helps in
exploratory analysis to control for confounders. For instance, maybe
Route B tends to carry more perishable items (which naturally spoil
faster). A Cox model could adjust for product type and still isolate the
effect of route itself. The output of a Cox model is typically expressed
in <strong>hazard ratios</strong> for each factor level (or for a
one-unit change in a numeric factor), which are intuitive for comparing
risks. If a hazard ratio is above 1, the factor is associated with a
higher risk (shorter time to event); if below 1, it’s associated with a
longer time to event (protective effect). Without diving into equations,
one can use Cox models in EDA to highlight which variables have the
strongest relationships with event timing. It’s like a form of
regression analysis tailored for time-to-event data (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=,116">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>), giving you deeper insight than comparing
simple averages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example:</em> A hypothetical Kaplan-Meier survival plot comparing
two shipping routes for time until a delay. The <strong>yellow curve
(Route A)</strong> stays higher for longer than the <strong>orange curve
(Route B)</strong>, indicating Route A’s shipments tend to remain
on-time longer. At day 5, for instance, a much larger proportion of
Route A shipments are still delay-free compared to Route B. Each
downward step in the curves represents one or more shipments
experiencing a delay at that time. We can see Route B’s curve drops
steeply earlier (around days 2–6), meaning many Route B shipments
encounter delays in that period, whereas Route A’s decline is more
gradual. By day 10, Route B has very few shipments left on-time (the
curve has fallen close to zero), whereas Route A still has a
considerable fraction of shipments with no delays. This visualization
makes it easy to compare the reliability of the two routes over time at
a glance. In a real analysis, such differences might prompt us to
investigate what’s happening on Route B – for example, perhaps a
particular hub or carrier on that route is causing delays. Kaplan-Meier
curves like this thus help reveal timing patterns and differences
between groups in a concrete, visual way.</p>
<h2 id="why-survival-analysis-is-valuable-in-supply-chain-eda">Why
Survival Analysis is Valuable in Supply Chain EDA</h2>
<p>In exploratory data analysis for supply chains, incorporating
survival analysis can significantly enhance insight discovery. Supply
chain processes often involve events over time (delays, failures,
stockouts, etc.), and understanding the <strong>temporal
dynamics</strong> of these events is crucial. Here are some key benefits
of using survival analysis in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Revealing Timing Patterns:</strong> Survival analysis
helps identify <em>when</em> events tend to occur, not just if they
occur. This is crucial for supply chain management. For example, you
might find that <strong>shipment delays mostly happen after the first
week in transit</strong> rather than uniformly at any time. This could
indicate that initial stages are smooth (customs clearance, early
transport legs), but risks accumulate later (perhaps last-mile delivery
issues). By spotting such patterns, you can target process improvements
at the specific phase of the supply chain where problems peak.
Traditional EDA might show overall delay rates, but survival curves
expose the <strong>time frame of risk</strong>, which is far more
actionable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of Event Occurrence Over Time:</strong> With
survival analysis, you can quantify the probability of events as a
function of time. For instance, you can answer questions like, <em>“What
is the probability a given shipment will still be on-time after 1 day, 5
days, 10 days?”</em> or <em>“By what time have 90% of shipments
completed delivery?”</em>. This is incredibly useful for setting
expectations and thresholds. In inventory management, you could
determine the probability that a part will last at least 6 months before
failure (useful for warranty or maintenance scheduling). These
time-based probabilities help in <strong>risk assessment and
planning</strong>. For example, if you see that by 30 days only 10% of a
certain product batch remains unsold (90% sold), that tells you
something about sales velocity and when you might stock out, informing
production schedules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comparing Different Groups or Scenarios:</strong>
Survival curves allow easy comparison between different categories or
strategies within your supply chain. You might compare
<strong>time-to-defect for components from Supplier A vs. Supplier
B</strong>, or <strong>time-to-delivery for shipments by Carrier X
vs. Carrier Y</strong>. If one curve is consistently lower (meaning
faster time to event), that group has a higher incidence of the event.
This could highlight underperformers; for example, if Supplier B’s parts
consistently fail sooner than Supplier A’s, you have clear evidence
(with time context) that Supplier B’s quality is worse. Similarly, you
could compare survival of products shipped in <strong>standard packaging
vs. enhanced packaging</strong> to see if the extra packaging truly
delays the time to damage/spoilage of goods in transit. These
comparisons during EDA can validate or challenge assumptions about
different processes and partners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying Factors Influencing Duration:</strong>
Through methods like the Cox model, survival analysis helps pinpoint
which factors significantly affect the timing of events (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=,116">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). In a complex supply chain dataset, there may
be many variables (routes, product types, warehouses, weather
conditions, etc.). A Cox regression in EDA can highlight, for example,
that <strong>temperature is a major factor in product spoilage
time</strong> (perhaps goods last 30% longer on average in cooler
conditions), or that <strong>shipment size is inversely related to
time-to-delivery (larger shipments face delays sooner)</strong>. By
uncovering these relationships, analysts can focus on the most impactful
factors. It’s a way of doing multivariate EDA with a time-to-event lens
– you’re not just seeing if a factor correlates with event occurrence,
but if it shifts the timeline of the event. This is especially valuable
in supply chain optimization, where you want to know not just
<em>if</em> a factor causes issues, but <em>how soon</em> those issues
manifest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling Partial Information Robustly:</strong> As
mentioned, censoring is naturally handled in survival analysis. In
supply chains, it’s common to have incomplete data (e.g., some units
never failed within the observation window, some shipments never
encountered delays, some orders are still in progress). Instead of
excluding these or waiting until all have events (which might never
happen), survival analysis includes them to improve estimates. This
means your EDA is based on all available data. For example, if 20% of
your deliveries have not yet arrived (still in transit), you can still
use survival analysis to estimate delivery time distributions without
bias – those in-transit orders will contribute knowledge (they’ve
“survived” at least X days so far) without falsely skewing the results.
Traditional analyses might ignore them or assume they had no event at
all, which can misrepresent reality. Survival analysis gives a
<strong>more accurate picture of process performance</strong>,
accounting for the fact that not all observations are complete.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insight into Process Reliability and Longevity:</strong>
Many supply chain questions boil down to reliability: how long can we go
without a problem? Survival analysis is essentially a reliability
analysis (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=Survival%20analysis%20is%20a%20branch,at%20what%20rate%20will%20they">Survival
analysis - Wikipedia</a>). If you consider a warehouse conveyor or a
delivery truck as the subject, you can use survival analysis to examine
<strong>time between breakdowns</strong>. If you treat an inventory
item’s shelf life as a time-to-event (spoilage or obsolescence),
survival analysis helps model that. By applying these methods, you bring
proven reliability engineering techniques into your exploratory
analysis. For example, a survival curve of <em>time until an
out-of-stock event</em> for different products might show that Product X
typically stocks out after 20 days if not replenished, whereas Product Y
lasts 35 days. This kind of insight is directly useful for inventory
policy setting. In short, survival analysis provides a <strong>unified
framework to assess durability, reliability, and timing</strong> for any
supply chain element, whether it’s physical goods, orders, or
processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, survival analysis enriches exploratory data analysis by
adding the <strong>temporal dimension</strong> to our understanding of
supply chain data. It helps us intuitively grasp not just how often, but
<strong>how soon</strong> events like delays, failures, or other
outcomes happen. By examining the survival (or failure) patterns,
analysts can detect bottlenecks and weaknesses in the supply chain,
compare performances (suppliers, routes, products) in terms of longevity
and reliability, and ultimately make data-driven decisions to improve
efficiency and reduce risk. Perhaps most importantly, all of these
insights are obtained without complex math or coding – the concepts can
be understood visually (through curves) and summarized in simple metrics
like “X% probability of surviving Y time” that are easy to communicate
to stakeholders. Survival analysis thus serves as a powerful, accessible
tool in the advanced data analyst’s toolkit for making sense of
<strong>when</strong> things happen in a supply chain, leading to
proactive strategies rather than reactive fixes.</p>

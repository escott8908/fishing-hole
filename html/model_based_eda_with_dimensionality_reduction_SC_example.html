Reduction?</h2>
<p>Dimensionality reduction is the process of simplifying a complex
dataset by reducing the number of variables (dimensions) it has while
still preserving the dataset’s important information (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#:~:text=Dimensionality%20reduction%2C%20or%20dimension%20reduction%2C,dimensional">Dimensionality
reduction - Wikipedia</a>). In practical terms, it means taking data
that might have dozens or even hundreds of columns and compressing it
into a few summarized features that capture the key patterns. The goal
is to create a <strong>low-dimensional</strong> representation of the
data that retains the meaningful properties of the original
<strong>high-dimensional</strong> data (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#:~:text=Dimensionality%20reduction%2C%20or%20dimension%20reduction%2C,observations%20and%2For%20large%20numbers%20of">Dimensionality
reduction - Wikipedia</a>). This simplification makes it much easier for
humans (and algorithms) to explore and visualize the data.
High-dimensional data can be overwhelming and hard to interpret, whereas
a reduced-dimensional view can reveal hidden structures in the data that
were not obvious before (<a

dimensionality reduction is like <strong>finding a simpler way to look
at complex data</strong> without losing the insights it contains (<a

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example (Understanding the Concept):</strong> Imagine each
supplier in a supply chain is described by 20 different performance
metrics (on-time delivery rate, defect rate, cost efficiency, etc.).
That means each supplier is a point in a 20-dimensional space –
impossible to visualize directly. Dimensionality reduction could
transform those 20 metrics into, say, two comprehensive factors: perhaps
one factor summarizing overall <strong>reliability</strong> and another
summarizing <strong>cost-effectiveness</strong>. Plotting suppliers on a
2D graph using these two factors would allow us to <strong>see
patterns</strong> – suppliers with similar profiles would group
together, and outliers (unusual suppliers) would stand apart. We’ve gone
from a 20-dimensional puzzle to an understandable 2D picture, all
without losing the essential differences between suppliers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="common-dimensionality-reduction-techniques">Common
Dimensionality Reduction Techniques</h2>
<p>Several techniques can perform dimensionality reduction. We will
briefly introduce a few popular ones in simple terms (no mathematics
required):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong> PCA is a
classic method that finds new <em>compound features</em> (called
<strong>principal components</strong>) which are combinations of your
original variables (<a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dimensionality-reduction/#:~:text=extraction%20stated%20above%20in%20the,of%20the%20variance%20as%20possible">Introduction
to Dimensionality Reduction | GeeksforGeeks</a>). These new features are
chosen to capture as much of the variation in your data as possible in
the first few components. In essence, PCA reduces the number of
variables by creating a smaller set of “summary” variables that still
hold most of the information from the original data (<a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dimensionality-reduction/#:~:text=1,features%20remain%2C%20optimizing%20model%20performance">Introduction
to Dimensionality Reduction | GeeksforGeeks</a>). It’s like identifying
the main underlying trends in the data. <em>(For example, PCA might
determine that in a dataset of 10 supply chain metrics, most of the
variability comes from two broad factors – perhaps “size of shipment”
and “delivery speed” – and it will use those two factors to represent
the data, dropping less informative details.)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
(t-SNE):</strong> t-SNE (pronounced “tee-snee”) is a newer, non-linear
technique especially useful for <strong>visualizing</strong>
high-dimensional data (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#:~:text=T,does%20not%20necessarily%20preserve%20densities">Dimensionality
reduction - Wikipedia</a>). It doesn’t focus on capturing overall
variance like PCA, but instead on preserving <strong>local
relationships</strong> – it tries to ensure that data points that were
close to each other in the original space (i.e. very similar data
points) stay close in the reduced space (<a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5125360#:~:text=t,chain%20operations%2C%20while%20the%20suggested">Artificial
Intelligence in Supply Chain Management: Optimizing Logistics and
Efficiency by Yuqin Meng :: SSRN</a>). The result is often a 2D or 3D
scatter plot where points naturally form clusters of similar items.
t-SNE is great for plotting things like customer segments or product
groupings, because it tends to form distinct group clusters if they
exist. <em>(In supply chain data, you could use t-SNE to take a
high-dimensional dataset of shipments (with attributes like weight,
volume, origin, destination, delivery time, etc.) and project it into
2D. Shipments with similar profiles – say, express small-package
deliveries – might cluster together in the plot, separate from, for
instance, bulk freight shipments.)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP):</strong> UMAP is another modern technique, conceptually similar
to t-SNE, used for visualization and exploration. It is designed to
maintain both <strong>local groupings and broader global
structure</strong> in the data when reducing dimensions (<a
href="https://encord.com/blog/dimentionality-reduction-techniques-machine-learning/#:~:text=2,handle%20large%20datasets%20and%20complex">Reducing
Dataset Size Without Losing Model Performance |  Encord</a>). In
practice, UMAP often preserves more of the overall data shape (global
trends) than t-SNE, while still highlighting clusters, and it tends to
be faster and more scalable on large datasets (<a
href="https://encord.com/blog/dimentionality-reduction-techniques-machine-learning/#:~:text=2,handle%20large%20datasets%20and%20complex">Reducing
Dataset Size Without Losing Model Performance |  Encord</a>). <em>(For
example, applying UMAP on a dataset of warehouse sensor readings with
many variables might reveal both the small clusters of similar
conditions <strong>and</strong> an overall gradient from “optimal
conditions” to “poor conditions” across the data – all in an
easy-to-visualize 2D plot.)</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques all have the same fundamental aim: <strong>compress
complex data into a form we can readily explore.</strong> Some, like
PCA, create <em>summary features</em> that can be used not only for
visualization but also in other analysis. Others, like t-SNE and UMAP,
are mostly used to create visual maps of the data to help find patterns
(they are particularly popular for exploratory data analysis because
they can show clustering or group structure very clearly). The technical
details differ, but as a user without an ML background, you can think of
each of these as a different recipe for <strong>reducing
complexity</strong> and <strong>bringing out patterns</strong> in your
data.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-dimensionality-reduction-in-supply-chain-eda">Why Use
Dimensionality Reduction in Supply Chain EDA?</h2>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is all about uncovering patterns,
trends, and anomalies in data. In supply chain management, data tends to
be <strong>high-dimensional and complex</strong> – you might be tracking
everything from shipping times, costs, and quantities to supplier
ratings, inventory levels, and demand forecasts, all at once.
Dimensionality reduction is extremely valuable in this context for
several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simplifying Complexity for Visualization:</strong> Supply
chain datasets often involve many variables, which is challenging to
visualize or reason about together (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=Logistics%20and%20supply%20chain%20operations,uncorrelated%20variables%20called%20principal%20components">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>). By projecting
data onto just two or three dimensions, dimensionality reduction makes
it <em>visually possible</em> to inspect relationships between records.
It becomes <em>“easier to visualize data, revealing hidden
patterns”</em> that would be lost in a giant spreadsheet of numbers (<a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dimensionality-reduction/#:~:text=,the%20model%20generalize%20better%20to">Introduction
to Dimensionality Reduction | GeeksforGeeks</a>). In a logistics
context, this simplification means analysts can literally see the
structure of data (clusters of similar shipments, groups of suppliers,
etc.) on a scatter plot. For example, instead of juggling a 10-column
table of supplier KPIs in your head, you might see a 2D chart where
suppliers naturally group into clusters (perhaps indicating supplier
segments like <strong>high-cost but reliable</strong>
vs. <strong>low-cost but variable</strong>). This kind of visual
grouping helps analysts quickly grasp the landscape of their
suppliers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Revealing Hidden Structure and Groups:</strong> Often,
important patterns in supply chain data are not obvious when looking at
raw tables. Dimensionality reduction can uncover <strong>latent
structure</strong> such as clusters or segments in the data. It has been
described as <em>“enabling the detection of underlying patterns while
removing noise.”</em> (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=1,underlying%20patterns%20while%20removing%20noise">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>) In other words,
it filters out the less important variation (noise or redundant
information) and highlights the fundamental groupings or trends. In EDA,
this is gold – it might reveal, for instance, that there are really two
main types of delivery routes in your network (say, <strong>urban
short-haul vs. long-distance routes</strong>), or that products
naturally fall into a few categories based on sales patterns. These
insights might not be coded explicitly in the data but emerge when many
variables are considered together. Dimensionality reduction brings those
to light by <strong>condensing multiple indicators into fewer
dimensions</strong> where such groupings become visually or
statistically apparent (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=,analytics%20and%20dynamic%20logistical%20environments">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reducing Noise and Redundancy:</strong> In supply chain
data, many variables can be correlated or overlapping (for example,
“total units sold” and “revenue” are related, as are “weight of
shipment” and “volume”). Too many overlapping variables can clutter
analysis and obscure real insights. Techniques like PCA effectively
<strong>eliminate redundant information</strong> by merging correlated
variables into a single component (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20PCA%20helps%20to%3A">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>). The benefit
during EDA is a cleaner, denser dataset where each dimension you look at
contributes something unique. This noise reduction sharpens the
analyst’s view of the data, ensuring that when you see a pattern, it’s
not an artifact of some redundant variables but a genuine insight. For
instance, you might combine several customer demand metrics into one or
two principal components that represent overall demand strength and
variability. Analyzing those components directly can make trends (like
seasonal vs. steady demand products) much clearer than sifting through
the original raw metrics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Highlighting Outliers and Anomalies:</strong> When you
reduce data to two dimensions for plotting, points that behave very
differently from others tend to stick out – literally, they might sit
far away from any cluster on the chart. In supply chain management,
spotting outliers can be crucial (e.g., an unusual spike in lead time
for a certain supplier, or an out-of-pattern shipping cost for a
particular route). Dimensionality reduction aids in outlier detection by
giving a visual context. If one warehouse’s data point lies isolated in
a PCA plot of warehouse performance, it immediately invites
investigation (perhaps that warehouse has a unique issue or an
exceptional practice worth examining). In this way, the technique helps
<strong>flag anomalies</strong> that warrant further analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintaining Interpretability in Exploration:</strong> A
key part of EDA is being able to interpret and explain patterns. With
fewer dimensions, it’s often easier to <em>explain</em> what is driving
patterns. For example, you might find that two principal components
explain, say, 80% of the variation in your supply chain dataset. If you
determine that one component roughly corresponds to “scale of
operations” and another to “performance efficiency,” you can discuss
your data in those terms, which are meaningful to business stakeholders.
Dimensionality reduction thus can translate a tangle of 20+ raw metrics
into a few understandable themes. This <strong>bridges the gap</strong>
between raw data and human insight, allowing supply chain analysts to
communicate findings more clearly. In fact, dimensionality reduction is
commonly used as a prelude to clustering analysis (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#:~:text=approaches%20can%20be%20further%20divided,step%20to%20facilitate%20other%20analyses">Dimensionality
reduction - Wikipedia</a>) – once data is reduced, you might formally
cluster it or just visually identify clusters, and then describe those
clusters in intuitive terms (e.g., <em>“Group A suppliers are high
volume, moderate cost; Group B are low volume, high cost”</em>,
etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, by using dimensionality reduction during exploratory
analysis, supply chain professionals can transform unwieldy datasets
into insightful visuals and summaries. It helps <strong>surface the
story</strong> hidden in the data – whether that’s a trend, a set of
groupings, or an oddball case that needs attention – without requiring
any advanced modeling or predictions. The process is purely about making
data easier to <em>explore and understand</em>. As one source notes,
projecting data to fewer dimensions “makes it easier to visualize and
interpret underlying patterns” in complex logistics datasets (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=,analytics%20and%20dynamic%20logistical%20environments">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>). This clarity is
incredibly valuable before diving into any detailed decision-making or
modeling.</p>
<h2 id="practical-examples-in-supply-chain-data">Practical Examples in
Supply Chain Data</h2>
<p>To make the benefits more concrete, let’s look at a few practical
examples of how dimensionality reduction can uncover insights in supply
chain data. These examples illustrate the kind of patterns one might
discover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clustering Suppliers by Performance:</strong> Suppose you
collect 15 different performance metrics for each supplier (delivery
punctuality, quality defect rate, contract cost, flexibility, etc.).
This is a 15-dimensional profile for each supplier. If you apply a
dimensionality reduction (like PCA) to condense these metrics into two
dimensions, you could then plot all suppliers on a 2D chart. You may
discover that suppliers naturally group into, say, <em>three
clusters</em>. For instance, one cluster might be suppliers that are
<strong>low-cost but often late</strong>, another cluster <strong>highly
reliable but expensive</strong>, and a third <strong>balanced in cost
and performance</strong>. These clusters weren’t explicitly labeled in
the data – they emerge from the patterns across many variables. By
reducing dimensions, we revealed a hidden segmentation of suppliers.
This insight could help in tailoring supplier management strategies for
each group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visualizing Shipment Patterns:</strong> Imagine a dataset
of shipments, where each shipment record has dozens of attributes:
weight, volume, origin, destination, ship date, delivery date, shipping
mode, distance, temperature sensitivity, etc. It’s hard to digest such
data in raw form. Using a technique like t-SNE or UMAP to reduce this to
two dimensions could produce a map where each point is a shipment
plotted in 2D. In this map, you might see clusters indicating different
<strong>types of shipments</strong>. For example, international freight
shipments might cluster in one area of the plot (characterized by long
distances, high weights, longer delivery times), whereas local express
deliveries cluster in another (short distance, small parcels, fast
delivery). Perhaps temperature-controlled shipments form their own
cluster. By simplifying the data, we allow these categories of shipments
to pop out visually. An analyst could then label those clusters and
realize, for instance, that <em>“Group X has all our cold-chain
shipments, which have similar profiles and challenges,”</em> leading to
deeper exploration of that group’s specifics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Streamlining Inventory Analytics:</strong> Consider
product inventory and sales data for a retail supply chain. Each product
might have multiple features: average weekly sales, seasonal sales
variation, lead time from supplier, shelf space occupied, perishability,
and so on. If we perform dimensionality reduction on these product
features, we might find that just two dimensions capture most of the
important differences. When we plot products in those two dimensions, we
could see a pattern like a continuum or clusters. For instance, products
might line up along one axis that differentiates <strong>high-turnover
vs. low-turnover items</strong>, and along another that differentiates
<strong>seasonal vs. steady demand</strong>. In the 2D plot, you might
identify a cluster of products that sell quickly only in summer (high
turnover, seasonal) versus those that sell steadily year-round (high
turnover, non-seasonal), etc. This view can inform inventory strategies
– e.g. the seasonal high-turnover items might need special promotional
planning or supplier readiness for peak season. Without dimensionality
reduction, it would be much harder to see this multi-factor pattern
across the product catalog.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detecting Anomalies in Operations:</strong> A warehouse
collects various metrics on its operations: pick rate, error rate,
equipment downtime, labor hours, orders fulfilled, and more. If we
compress these operational metrics into two principal components, each
day or each warehouse can be plotted as a point. Perhaps most points
cluster fairly tightly, representing “normal” operation range, but a few
points lie far off. Those outliers might correspond to days of unusual
activity – maybe a day where a system failure caused a big slowdown
(reflected in low pick rate, high downtime), or a warehouse that
performs exceptionally well on all metrics. By reducing dimensions, we
combined multiple indicators into a holistic view of operations, making
aberrations stand out clearly. This could prompt a root cause analysis
for the off-normal days or replication of best practices from the
unusually good performers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these examples shows how dimensionality reduction <em>does
not remove meaningful information; it highlights it</em>. By
<strong>simplifying complex, high-dimensional data, we’re able to detect
underlying patterns</strong> that matter for supply chain decisions (<a
href="https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/top-5-ways-pca-transforms-logistics-supply-chain#:~:text=1,underlying%20patterns%20while%20removing%20noise">Top
5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>). The technique
turns raw data into a form where insight jumps out, which is the essence
of exploratory analysis. Whether it’s grouping similar cases together or
spotting differences, dimensionality reduction provides a lens to view
the data’s structure directly. Supply chain professionals can then
leverage these findings – perhaps to segment suppliers, optimize
shipping categories, adjust inventory policy for different product
groups, or investigate anomalies – all insights gleaned
<strong>before</strong> any predictive modeling or heavy analytics, just
by smart data transformation and visualization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dimensionality reduction is a powerful aid for anyone performing
exploratory analysis on supply chain data. It <strong>intuitively
defines a simpler space</strong> in which to examine your information,
without demanding advanced mathematical understanding. By reducing many
variables into a few, you gain the ability to <strong>visualize
patterns, relationships, and structures</strong> that would otherwise
remain hidden in a tangle of numbers. Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and
UMAP each provide different ways to achieve this simplification, but all
serve the same purpose: helping you find meaning in complexity. In the
context of supply chain management – with its myriad moving parts and
metrics – dimensionality reduction can be the key to unlocking
actionable insights. It enables analysts to <strong>see the forest for
the trees</strong>, whether that means identifying clusters of similar
suppliers, discovering distinct types of shipments, or spotting an
outlier warehouse operation. By embracing dimensionality reduction as a
routine step in exploratory data analysis, organizations can derive
clearer insights from their supply chain data and make more informed,
data-driven decisions with confidence in the patterns they’ve uncovered
(<a

5 Ways PCA Transforms Logistics &amp; Supply Chain</a>). The data may be
high-dimensional, but our understanding doesn’t have to be.
Dimensionality reduction ensures that even the most complex supply chain
dataset can tell a clear and compelling story.</p>

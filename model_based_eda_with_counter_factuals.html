Analysis: “What If?” Storytelling in Supply Chains</h1>
<p>Counterfactual analysis is simply the structured practice of asking
“what if” questions. In plain terms, it asks <strong>“What would have
happened if one thing were different?”</strong> For example, “what if we
had ordered 20% less product?” or “what if our supplier responded two
days earlier?” By contrasting the actual data (“factual”) with a
hypothetical alternate scenario, we can uncover hidden patterns and
causal intuition. As one source notes, counterfactual analysis is
fundamentally about comparing the real scenario to a hypothetical one
with one or more conditions altered. This approach isn’t merely
daydreaming – it’s a structured way to examine cause and effect by
building an alternate version of history and seeing how outcomes
shift.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-counterfactuals-minimal-vs.-plausible">Types of
Counterfactuals: Minimal vs. Plausible</h2>
<p>Counterfactual scenarios can be chosen in different ways. A
<strong>minimal counterfactual</strong> changes as little as possible
from reality – just enough to flip the outcome. For example, if a loan
was denied, the minimal counterfactual might be “income just $500 higher
(instead of $3000) to get approved.” In practice, a minimal
counterfactual “indicates the smallest change in feature values that can
translate to a different outcome”. By contrast, a <strong>plausible
counterfactual</strong> imagines a scenario that is realistic and in
line with normal patterns. It might involve larger or multiple changes,
as long as those changes are believable. In this view, a plausible
counterfactual keeps things similar to the known data – it “is realistic
because it is ‘similar’ to the known dataset and adheres to observed
correlations”. In other words, minimal changes focus on hitting the
exact tipping point, whereas plausible changes focus on a sensible
real-world alternative.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example (minimal):</em> Raise lead time by just 1 day to see if
an on-time delivery becomes late.</li>
<li><em>Example (plausible):</em> Model a scenario where average lead
time drops by 20% (e.g. a process improvement), even if that’s more than
the bare minimum change.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-counterfactuals-differ-from-shap-ice-and-pdp">How
Counterfactuals Differ from SHAP, ICE, and PDP</h2>
<p>Traditional explainable-AI tools like SHAP, ICE (Individual
Conditional Expectation), and PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) answer
different questions. SHAP and related methods look <em>backward</em> at
a model or data: they <strong>explain why</strong> a particular outcome
happened by attributing contributions to features. For instance, SHAP
might say “Feature X contributed +5 to the prediction.” PDP and ICE
plots show how predictions vary with a feature (averaged or
per-instance) in the existing data. These tools help us interpret the
<em>model’s behavior</em> or the data’s correlations, essentially
telling us “what happened” given the data.</p>
<p>By contrast, counterfactual analysis looks <em>forward</em> to
alternative worlds: it asks <strong>“what would happen if we changed
this input?”</strong> rather than “why did this prediction happen?”
Instead of assigning blame or plotting average effects, counterfactuals
explicitly <strong>interrogate</strong> the system with hypothetical
tweaks. As one explanation puts it, conventional interpretability might
rank features by importance, but counterfactual analysis “interrogates”
the model to find what adjustments would flip the decision. In short:
SHAP/ICE/PDP show how the current data produce outcomes, while
counterfactuals imagine new data (with one thing changed) and explore
the resulting outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example (SHAP/PDP):</em> A PDP might show that, on average,
increasing order quantity tends to increase profit. SHAP would say
“order quantity had a +X contribution to this sale’s profit
prediction.”</li>
<li><em>Counterfactual twist:</em> Instead, ask “if we actually reduced
that order quantity to 80%, how much less profit would we see?” and
actually simulate the result.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-counterfactuals-enrich-exploratory-analysis">Why
Counterfactuals Enrich Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Counterfactual thinking transforms EDA from description into
exploration of alternatives. Rather than stopping at “what patterns
exist?”, it encourages <strong>creative, scenario-based
analysis</strong>. For example, a counterfactual approach might reveal
that <em>if</em> supplier A had shipped parts 2 days faster, then
on-time delivery rates would have jumped 15% (a pattern not obvious from
the raw data alone). By adding these hypothetical “what-if” views,
counterfactuals can <strong>surface insights hidden in correlational
data</strong>. In fact, research shows that presenting counterfactual
scenarios can improve understanding of complex data. One study found
that integrating counterfactual reasoning into visual analytics
<em>improved users’ understanding of visualized data</em> and led
analysts to draw more accurate causal conclusions than relying on
correlation alone. In other words, counterfactual guidance in
visualization helped people infer cause-effect links more precisely than
standard correlation-based guidance.</p>
<p>From a practical EDA standpoint, counterfactual analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reveals hidden relationships.</strong> By hypothetically
tweaking a supply chain factor, we see the downstream effects. This can
highlight bottlenecks or leverage points (e.g., realizing that a small
improvement in response time yields big gains in delivery
reliability).</li>
<li><strong>Encourages hypothesis testing.</strong> It frames EDA as an
iterative experiment: “Let’s assume X was different and see if Y changes
as expected.” That mindset often uncovers unexpected patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Supports scenario planning.</strong> Supply chain teams
already use “what-if” planning to assess risks. Counterfactual analysis
brings that practice into the data: for example, simulating a delayed
component to see whole-system impact. As one supply chain blog explains,
scenario planning provides tools to “pinpoint risks and opportunities”
by outlining “what-if” scenarios. Counterfactual EDA applies the same
idea, using actual data to quantify those scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Gives new “data” to visualize.</strong> Instead of only the
observed values, analysts get a paired set of counterfactual outcomes.
Charts can show <em>both</em> the real data and the alternative, making
patterns (or lack thereof) clearer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, counterfactual analysis is not about building a new
predictive model to optimize supply chain; it’s about <strong>deepening
insight</strong>. It doesn’t need to be coded – even simple simulations
or adjusted visualizations count as counterfactual thinking.</p>
<h2 id="supply-chain-what-if-examples">Supply-Chain “What If?”
Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>“What if a supplier had responded faster?”</strong> Suppose
the data show many orders arriving late. A counterfactual scenario might
subtract 2 days from each supplier’s response time and then recompute
delivery delays. A <strong>before/after timeline chart</strong> could
overlay the original delivery dates (in one color) with the simulated
earlier dates (in another). If many deliveries shift above the “on-time”
line, we learn that supplier lag is a key cause of delays. For instance,
a bar chart of late shipments before vs. after the change would
highlight how many backlogs would disappear under the faster-supply
scenario.</li>
<li><strong>“What if order quantities were smaller?”</strong> Large
orders might be causing storage or rush fees. We could hypothetically
reduce each order by, say, 20% in the data and see what changes. An
<strong>annotated table</strong> could list a sample of orders with
original vs. reduced quantity and compare inventory turns or total
costs. Alternatively, a <strong>heatmap</strong> of stock levels
“before” and “after” would show where inventory pressure eases. This can
uncover nonlinear effects, e.g. seeing that small cuts in orders of the
slowest-moving items free up space disproportionately.</li>
<li><strong>“What if lead time was shortened?”</strong> Lead time (time
from order to delivery) is often critical. Counterfactually, we could
simulate all shipments arriving 3 days earlier. A <strong>stacked bar or
gantt chart</strong> could then show original vs. counterfactual
schedules for a set of products. On a map of the network, one could
color routes by the difference in arrival date; routes turning green in
the “after” map indicate improved reliability. This visual storytelling
makes it easy to see which products or routes benefit most from
lead-time reductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each scenario is a mini-EDA exploration: by systematically altering
one factor in the dataset (supplier response, order size, lead time,
etc.), the analyst can plot or tabulate both real and counterfactual
outcomes. These comparisons often reveal surprising patterns. For
example, a company might discover that shaving just one day off average
lead time reduces stockouts by 30%, or that trimming orders of
slow-moving items dramatically cuts holding costs.</p>
<h2 id="visual-storytelling-with-counterfactuals">Visual Storytelling
with Counterfactuals</h2>
<p>Counterfactual analysis lends itself to before/after visuals and
annotated comparisons. Here are some common storytelling approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side-by-side charts (“Before vs. After”).</strong> Plot the
original metric and the counterfactual metric next to each other. For
example, two histograms of delivery delays (real vs. with faster
supplier response) immediately show the shift in distribution. Or use
overlapping line charts/timelines with different colors for actual
vs. hypothetical scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Difference maps or heatmaps.</strong> On a geographic or
network diagram, color-code the change. For instance, a map of shipping
routes could use one color for actual delays and another for the
counterfactual delays; areas that turn green (improved) are easy to
spot. Similarly, a matrix or table of routes×months could use shades to
indicate how much each would improve under the scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Annotated tables or dashboards.</strong> Create a table
listing key records (e.g. top 10 late shipments) with columns for the
original outcome and the counterfactual outcome, highlighting
differences. Or build an interactive dashboard where a slider adjusts a
factor (like lead time), and charts update to show new outcomes
instantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>These visual tools make the counterfactual insights concrete. Rather
than only reading numbers, stakeholders <em>see</em> the impact of a
hypothetical change. This can guide decisions: if a chart shows that a
small reduction in order size virtually eliminates stockouts, the team
might prioritize that change.</p>
<p>Overall, counterfactual analysis supplements EDA by adding a layer of
“alternate history” to data exploration. It encourages asking smart
“what-if” questions and using visuals to compare realities. In effect,
it turns ordinary data charts into <strong>exploratory
narratives</strong>: by visualizing both what happened and what could
have happened, analysts gain a richer understanding of supply chain
dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Counterfactual analysis is defined as
asking “what if?” by comparing factual data to a hypothetical
alternative. Minimal counterfactuals involve the smallest change needed
for a new outcome, while plausible counterfactuals stay close to
realistic data patterns. Unlike SHAP, ICE, or PDP (which explain the
model’s predictions on observed data), counterfactuals
<em>interrogate</em> the scenario to see how outcomes would change.
Research in visual analytics confirms that counterfactual visualization
can improve understanding of data and causal insights beyond correlation
alone, an especially powerful approach when exploring complex supply
chain datasets.</p>

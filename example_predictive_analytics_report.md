## 📄 Executive Summary

This report presents the development and evaluation of a machine learning model designed to predict the **presence of heart disease** using patient-level clinical features from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to support early risk detection and triage decisions by identifying patients likely to have heart disease based on non-invasive features.

The final model — a Random Forest classifier — achieved an **AUC of 0.91**, with strong sensitivity in identifying patients at moderate to high risk. Key predictors include chest pain type, ST depression (`oldpeak`), exercise-induced angina, and age.

We recommend integrating this model into a triage support tool to prioritize further testing for high-risk individuals, and continuing evaluation with broader datasets for generalizability.

## 📚 Introduction

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early identification of high-risk patients is critical to prevent adverse outcomes. While traditional diagnostic methods rely on invasive or costly procedures, machine learning models using simple clinical features may provide effective pre-screening tools.

This report presents a **predictive modeling pipeline** using the Cleveland subset of the UCI Heart Disease dataset, aiming to forecast the **binary presence** of heart disease (`target > 0`) based on 13 clinical features.

## 🧪 Data and Methodology

### 🔹 Data Overview

* **Dataset**: Cleveland Heart Disease (303 rows, 14 features)
* **Target**: Binary classification (`0 = no disease`, `1 = disease present`)
* **Features Used**:

  * Demographics: `age`, `sex`
  * Symptoms & diagnostics: `cp`, `exang`, `oldpeak`, `thalach`, `thal`, `restecg`
  * Lab values: `chol`, `trestbps`, `fbs`
  * Others: `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)

### 🔹 Data Preparation

* Converted `num` target into binary (0 vs. 1–4)
* Categorical features one-hot encoded (`cp`, `thal`, `restecg`)
* Missing values in `thal` and `ca` handled using simple imputation (mode)
* Train-test split: 80/20
* Standardized numeric features

### 🔹 Modeling Approach

* Models Tested:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* Evaluation Metrics:

  * AUC-ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  * SHAP for model explainability
* Cross-validation: 5-fold on training set

## 📊 Analysis and Findings

### 🔹 Model Performance Summary (Test Set)

| Model               | AUC      | Accuracy | Recall   | Precision | F1-score |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.85     | 0.84     | 0.81     | 0.87      | 0.84     |
| Random Forest       | **0.91** | **0.86** | **0.88** | 0.86      | **0.87** |
| XGBoost             | 0.89     | 0.85     | 0.85     | **0.88**  | 0.86     |

> **Conclusion**: The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest balance of precision and recall with strong generalization performance.

### 🔹 Top Predictive Features (SHAP Summary)

1. **Chest Pain Type (cp)** – Atypical and asymptomatic pain strongly predictive of disease
2. **ST Depression (`oldpeak`)** – Higher values associated with greater risk
3. **Exercise-Induced Angina (`exang`)** – Strong indicator of disease presence
4. **Age** – Patients >55 showed higher predicted probabilities
5. **Maximum Heart Rate (`thalach`)** – Lower values often associated with positive disease class

### 🔹 SHAP Interaction Insights

* Interaction between **age and oldpeak** explains much of the variation in borderline-risk cases
* Certain `thal` categories amplify the risk score when combined with atypical chest pain

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on the predictive findings, we recommend the following actions:

1. **Integrate Risk Scoring in Pre-Screening Workflows**

   * Use the model to flag patients with a predicted probability >70% for follow-up diagnostics such as imaging or stress testing.

2. **Target High-Risk Profiles for Preventive Action**

   * Focus preventive education and interventions on patients over 55 with chest pain type 3 or 4, high `oldpeak`, and positive `exang`.

3. **Automate Clinical Decision Support**

   * Implement the model into an EHR-based triage assistant that surfaces risk scores during routine checkups or primary care encounters.

4. **Expand and Validate**

   * Apply the model to additional hospital datasets (e.g., VA, MIMIC) to test for generalizability and fairness across populations.

5. **Monitor Performance and Retrain**

   * Establish a monitoring plan to revalidate model performance quarterly and retrain as needed when data drift is detected.

## 🔚 Conclusion

This predictive analytics report demonstrates that using clinical features such as chest pain type, ST depression, and exercise-induced angina, we can forecast the presence of heart disease with high accuracy. The Random Forest model offers a robust foundation for decision support and triage systems.

Further validation and integration into clinical workflows will be critical to maximizing real-world impact. These predictive insights should complement — not replace — physician judgment, serving as an early warning layer in a larger care framework.

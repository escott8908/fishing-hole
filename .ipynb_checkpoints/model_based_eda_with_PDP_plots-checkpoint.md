# Partial Dependence Plots: Uncovering Feature Effects in Supply Chain EDA

## What Are Partial Dependence Plots?

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are **graphical tools** that show how one feature (or a pair of features) influences an outcome of interest, **while holding all other variables constant** ([Partial Dependence Plots. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a… | by Sai Kumar Varanasi | Medium](https://medium.com/@kumar9059300448/partial-dependence-plots-f1464ce66f1a#:~:text=Partial%20Dependence%20Plots%20,feature%20influence%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20predictions)) ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=A%20Partial%20Dependence%20Plot%20,making%20process)). In practice, PDPs come from machine learning: they illustrate how a model’s prediction changes as a particular input feature changes, isolating that feature’s effect on the outcome ([Partial Dependence Plots. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a… | by Sai Kumar Varanasi | Medium](https://medium.com/@kumar9059300448/partial-dependence-plots-f1464ce66f1a#:~:text=Partial%20Dependence%20Plots%20,feature%20influence%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20predictions)). In simple terms, a PDP asks: *“If we change this one factor, what happens to our outcome on average, assuming nothing else changes?”* 

By isolating a feature’s influence, PDPs reveal the **average relationship** between that feature and the target result ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=Partial%20Dependence%20Plots%20work%20by,making%20and%20%2024)). This helps analysts understand whether a factor has a **linear effect** (a straight-line increase or decrease) or a more complex impact on the outcome ([19  Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html#:~:text=The%20partial%20dependence%20plot%20,a%20linear%20regression%20model%2C%20partial)). For example, a PDP might show that increasing a feature gradually boosts the outcome up to a point, after which the effect levels off – indicating a threshold or diminishing returns ([19  Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html#:~:text=The%20partial%20dependence%20plot%20,a%20linear%20regression%20model%2C%20partial)). Such insights into the shape of a relationship (whether steady, accelerating, or flattening) are valuable for interpreting patterns in data.

## How PDPs Work (Holding Other Factors Constant)

PDPs achieve their “all else equal” view by averaging out the influence of all other features. Conceptually, to create a partial dependence plot for one feature, you **vary that feature’s value** through its range and see how the outcome changes on average:

1. **Select a feature and values:** Pick the feature of interest (e.g., *shipping distance*) and define a set of values spanning its range (from low to high).  
2. **Fix the feature and predict:** For each chosen value, temporarily set **all records** in the data to have that feature value, and use your model (or analysis) to predict the outcome for every record with this fixed setting.  
3. **Average the outcome:** Take the **average** of all those predicted outcomes. This gives the typical outcome when the feature is held at that specific value (with other variables effectively constant).  
4. **Plot the results:** Plot the feature’s value on the x-axis against the average predicted outcome on the y-axis. Connecting these points yields the PDP curve, showing how changes in the feature alone would change the outcome ([Partial Dependence Plots. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a… | by Sai Kumar Varanasi | Medium](https://medium.com/@kumar9059300448/partial-dependence-plots-f1464ce66f1a#:~:text=METHODOLOGY%3A)).

This process creates a clear chart of the feature’s isolated effect. Essentially, the PDP is telling us: *“On average, when this feature is X, the outcome is Y”* – repeating that for many values to draw a profile of the relationship. By averaging over other factors, PDPs strip away noise from confounding variables. This means that even if in real data many factors move together, the PDP can single out one factor’s contribution. It’s a bit like running a controlled experiment on your data: change one thing and see the result. The end result is an **intuitive curve** that analysts can read to understand the feature’s impact without other influences in the mix.

## 1D vs. 2D Partial Dependence Plots

PDPs come in two flavors, depending on how many features you examine at once:

- **1D PDP (One-Dimensional):** This plot shows how a **single feature** affects the outcome when all others are held constant ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome)). It’s usually a simple line graph. The feature’s values (e.g., distance in miles) run along the x-axis, and the y-axis shows the model’s predicted outcome (e.g., delivery time) for those feature values. A 1D PDP makes it easy to see the trend — whether the outcome rises, falls, or has bends as the feature increases. For instance, a 1D PDP could show how increasing *shipment distance* gradually increases *delivery time*, tracing a clear curve.  

- **2D PDP (Two-Dimensional):** This plot examines **two features together** and their joint effect on the outcome ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome)). It’s often visualized as a surface or heatmap instead of a single line. One feature might be on the x-axis (e.g., distance) and the second on the y-axis (e.g., shipment weight or size), with the outcome represented by color intensity or contour lines. A 2D PDP reveals **interaction effects** – situations where the impact of one feature depends on the value of another ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome)). For example, a 2D plot might show that for short distances, increasing shipment weight has a mild cost impact, but for very long distances, heavy shipments drive the cost **sharply** higher. Such a plot surfaces patterns that wouldn’t appear in a one-feature-at-a-time view.

In summary, **1D PDPs** give a focused view of one factor’s influence, and **2D PDPs** let us explore how two factors combine to affect outcomes. If the two features do not interact, the 2D PDP will look like a simple additive effect; but if there is an interaction, the 2D plot will highlight regions where outcomes change in a way that one feature alone couldn’t explain. This helps analysts pinpoint not only individual drivers but also synergy or interference between drivers in complex data.

## Why Are PDPs Valuable for Supply Chain Analysis?

Supply chain data is often **complex**, with many interdependent factors (distance, time, cost, supplier ratings, demand levels, etc.) influencing outcomes. PDPs are especially valuable in this context because they help analysts untangle these factors and gain clearer insights during exploratory data analysis:

- **Isolate Each Factor’s Impact:** PDPs allow supply chain analysts to focus on one factor at a time and see its true effect on outcomes without other variables clouding the picture ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=Partial%20Dependence%20Plots%20work%20by,making%20and%20%2024)). For example, you can examine how *lead time* alone affects on-time delivery rates, factoring out other influences. This isolation builds confidence about which drivers really matter and how.  
- **Visualize Trends and Thresholds:** By charting the relationship, PDPs make it easy to spot **trends, patterns, or thresholds** in feature effects. You can tell if a relationship is roughly linear or if it changes behavior at certain points ([19  Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) – Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html#:~:text=The%20partial%20dependence%20plot%20,a%20linear%20regression%20model%2C%20partial)). For instance, a PDP might show that increasing a warehouse’s inventory up to a certain level sharply improves order fulfillment rate, but beyond that level the benefit tapers off – revealing a saturation point. Such intuitive visuals help in understanding and communicating where diminishing returns or critical cut-offs lie.  
- **Reveal Interactions Between Factors:** Supply chain outcomes often involve **interactions** (one factor’s effect depends on another). A 2D PDP can uncover these. Perhaps *high demand* only causes delays when *inventory is low* – an interaction effect. By looking at two features together, analysts can identify combinations that lead to bottlenecks or high costs, which wouldn’t be obvious from isolated analysis ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,effect%20on%20the%20predicted%20outcome)). Catching these interactions is key to optimizing complex processes (for example, knowing that *distance* and *shipping mode* together determine if a delivery will be late).  
- **Data-Driven Decision Support:** PDPs turn raw model/data output into a form that decision-makers can easily interpret. They answer “What if” questions with concrete visuals. In supply chain management, companies use PDP insights to guide decisions – for example, understanding how changes in **demand or supply variables affect overall efficiency and inventory needs** ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=,quality%2C%20helping%20to%20implement%20improvements)). By seeing the effect of raising demand forecasts or adjusting safety stock levels on outcomes like service level or cost, managers can make more informed choices. Likewise, in manufacturing, PDPs have been used to analyze how altering a process or using higher-quality materials would impact **product defect rates** ([❓ What is a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) : definition, examples of use.](https://ai-terms-glossary.com/item/partial-dependence-plot/#:~:text=logistics%20and%20inventory%20decisions.%20,quality%2C%20helping%20to%20implement%20improvements)). This kind of insight is extremely valuable for continuous improvement and risk management.

Notably, PDPs have been highlighted as useful by researchers and analysts in supply chain contexts. For example, one study pointed out that business analysts at a manufacturer might want to know *“how changes in their supply chain affect defect rates,”* which is exactly the type of question PDPs help to explore. By providing a clear view of cause-and-effect within complex supply chain systems, PDPs enhance the exploratory analysis process, helping analysts validate assumptions and discover new patterns hidden in the data.

## Practical Examples in Supply Chain

Let’s consider a few concrete examples of how PDPs can uncover insights in supply chain data. These scenarios assume we have a predictive model or analysis for the outcome of interest, and we use PDPs to interpret the relationships:

- **Shipment Distance vs. Delivery Time:** Imagine we have data on shipments and their delivery times. A 1D PDP for **shipping distance** would show how *delivery time* is expected to change as distance increases, with all other factors (like shipping method, weather, etc.) averaged out. We might see a steadily rising curve – confirming that longer distances generally lead to longer delivery times on average. For example, the PDP could tell us that increasing a route from 100 to 500 miles adds a few extra days of transit time (on average). This isolated view quantifies the intuitive idea that “farther shipments take longer,” and it might reveal whether the relationship is proportional or if, say, beyond a certain distance the delivery time doesn’t increase as much (perhaps because air freight is used for extremely long distances, leveling off the curve). Supply chain planners can use this insight to **predict delays** and manage customer expectations based on shipment distance.

- **Supplier Quality vs. Defect Rate:** Consider a manufacturing supply chain where each supplier has a quality rating, and we track the *defect rate* (percentage of products with defects) from each supplier’s shipments. A PDP for **supplier quality score** would illustrate how the defect rate changes as the quality rating improves, holding other factors (like shipment size or distance) constant. We might observe, for instance, that as supplier quality moves from a score of 6 to 8 (out of 10), the defect rate drops significantly (meaning far fewer defective parts), but improving from 8 to 10 yields a smaller additional improvement. This tells us two things: better supplier quality clearly leads to fewer defects, and there may be **diminishing returns** – once quality is very high, other factors might limit further reduction in defects. Such a plot helps procurement and quality teams decide how much emphasis to put on supplier development or screening. It provides a data-backed, visual confirmation that *“higher supplier quality means lower defects,”* and pinpoints roughly how much improvement in defects to expect from a given improvement in quality score.

- **Distance and Shipment Size vs. Shipping Cost (2D PDP):** In logistics, **shipping cost** is influenced by multiple factors. Suppose we want to examine how both *distance* and *shipment size/weight* together affect cost. A 2D PDP could be generated with distance on one axis and shipment weight on the other, and color shading to represent the predicted shipping cost. This 2D plot might show, for example, that for short-distance shipments, increasing the weight from light to heavy causes a moderate rise in cost, whereas for long-distance shipments, the same increase in weight causes a **steep jump** in cost. In other words, the plot could reveal an interaction: distance amplifies the effect of weight on cost. Perhaps shipping something heavy over a very long route triggers a surcharge or requires a more expensive mode of transport, resulting in disproportionately higher costs. By examining this PDP, a logistics manager might conclude that *“when planning long-haul shipments, keeping weight down yields especially big savings,”* whereas for short hauls weight is less critical to cost. This kind of insight, drawn from the combined effect of two features, can guide strategic decisions like how to **allocate heavy products to nearer distribution centers** or when to split a shipment into smaller batches.

Each of these examples demonstrates how PDPs turn raw data relationships into an understandable story. They help supply chain professionals answer specific questions: *How much does distance matter for delivery timing? In what way does supplier quality impact defects? What’s the joint effect of distance and size on cost?* By providing clear, focused views of these relationships, PDPs enhance exploratory data analysis, allowing experts to derive actionable insights from complex supply chain datasets without getting lost in the weeds of multivariate interactions.

Absolutely—asking the **right questions** during exploratory data analysis (EDA) is key to uncovering **insights** that are **clear, relevant, and impactful** to your customer.

Here’s a comprehensive list organized by theme. Think of it as your **EDA checklist**—your personal detective toolkit for getting to know any dataset and telling a compelling story about it.

---

## 🧩 **1. General Data Understanding**
- What is the shape of the dataset (rows, columns)?
- What does each column represent? What is the unit, if any?
- What are the data types (numerical, categorical, text, date)?
- Is this structured (tabular), time series, or unstructured (text/image) data?
- What is the primary entity or observation unit (a person, transaction, machine, etc.)?
- Is there a target variable? What are we trying to predict, understand, or optimize?

---

## 🔍 **2. Data Quality**
- Are there missing values? How many per column?
    - Are they random, patterned, or systemic?
- Are there duplicate rows?
- Are there constant or near-constant columns?
- Are there unexpected values (e.g., negative ages, future dates, special characters)?

---

## 📏 **3. Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**
- What are the min, max, mean, median, std, skewness, and kurtosis for each numerical variable?
- Are distributions normal, skewed, or multimodal?
    - Are there extreme outliers? Are they errors or legitimate?
- Do any variables have large variance or a wide range?
- Which values appear most frequently (mode)?
- Do any numerical columns show heavy-tailed distributions?

---

## 📊 **4. Categorical Variables**
- How many unique values are there per categorical column?
- What is the frequency of each category? Are any dominant?
- Are any categories rare or have too few occurrences?
- Are categories cleanly formatted (e.g., consistent spelling/casing)?

---

## ⏳ **5. Time-Based Questions (if applicable)**
- What is the time range of the data?
- Are there gaps or bursts in time?
- Are there temporal trends or seasonality?
- Are key metrics stable or changing over time?
- Is there a timestamp granularity issue (e.g., all dates the same, only daily resolution)?

---

## 🧮 **6. Relationships Between Variables**
- Which variables are strongly correlated (positively or negatively)?
- Are there multicollinear features (i.e., redundant information)?
- Are there interesting interactions between features (e.g., only when A and B happen together)?
- Are there group-level differences (e.g., average metric by category)?

---

## 🧠 **7. Feature Engineering Opportunities**
- Are there columns that can be combined (e.g., year + month)?
- Can you create ratios, flags, or aggregates?
- Are there temporal features to extract (e.g., day of week, hour)?
- Can you bucket or bin continuous variables (e.g., age groups, price bands)?
- Can you encode hierarchical or ordinal relationships?

---

## 🧼 **8. Target Variable Exploration (if supervised task)**
- Is the target balanced or imbalanced?
- How is the target variable distributed across key features?
- Are there data leakage risks (features that “cheat” by knowing the future)?
- How does the target evolve over time or by group?

---

## 🚩 **9. Anomalies & Red Flags**
- Are there clusters of missing data for certain rows/groups?
- Are there inconsistent relationships (e.g., younger person with high pension)?
- Are there suspicious timestamp patterns (e.g., all events logged at the same second)?
- Are there duplicated IDs, names, or transaction numbers?
- Do repeated exact values suggest automation, human error, or sensor defaults?

---

## 📣 **10. Communicating to the Customer**
- What trends or insights matter most to the customer’s domain?
- How does each insight tie back to the business problem or goal?
- Can you offer a possible explanation or hypothesis for each insight?
- What decisions could be influenced by these insights?
- Where should further data collection or deeper analysis happen?

## ✨ Bonus: Your Narrative Template for Each Variable
For each important column, answer:
1. **What does this variable measure, and why does it matter?**
2. **How is it distributed?**
3. **What is typical (mean/median), and what is unusual (outliers)?**
4. **How does it relate to the target or other variables?**
5. **What should the customer know or do about it?**

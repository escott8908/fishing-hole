`I need you to perform as an expert on developing data science reports for customers, complete with a title all the way to the end with recommendations and conclusions.  i plan on developing separate documents: descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, and predictive analytics.  i'd like a format for each of these separate reports.  let's please work with diagnostic analytics report.  please ask me any clarifying questions to provide me with a 95% confident response.`

Thanks for the detailed input ‚Äî this gives me everything needed to provide you with a **Diagnostic Analytics Report Template** that‚Äôs high-impact, technically rigorous, and versatile across formats.

## üß≠ Diagnostic Analytics Report Template

**Purpose**: Identify drivers, patterns, and root causes underlying observed outcomes or disparities in the data.

---

### 1. **Title Page**

* **Title**: *Diagnostic Analytics Report ‚Äì \[Project Name or Case Study]*
* **Subtitle** *(optional)*: e.g., ‚ÄúIdentifying Risk Factors Associated with Heart Disease Severity‚Äù
* **Author / Team**
* **Date**
* **Version / Revision**

---

### 2. **Executive Summary**

* 1‚Äì2 paragraph summary of:

  * The **business question(s)** or diagnostic hypothesis
  * Key root causes or contributing factors discovered
  * How these findings **inform clinical or operational decisions**
  * Suggested next steps (e.g., predictive modeling, intervention)

---

### 3. **Background & Objective**

* Brief context of the problem domain
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúHeart disease remains a leading cause of death. This analysis aims to uncover key clinical features contributing to disease severity.‚Äù)*
* Specific diagnostic questions being answered (from your list, e.g.):

  * *What explains the differences in severity across age groups?*
  * *What features interact to influence asymptomatic heart disease cases?*
* Importance of understanding **why**, not just **what**

---

### 4. **Data Overview**

* **Source** (e.g., Cleveland Heart Disease dataset)
* **Timeframe** (if applicable)
* **Number of records / features**
* **Key variables**
* **Target / outcome variable(s)**: What are we explaining? (e.g., `num`, heart disease severity level)

---

### 5. **Data Preparation**

* **Cleaning actions taken** (e.g., imputed missing values, removed outliers, encoded categories)
* **Feature selection or transformation** (e.g., binning age, scaling cholesterol)
* **Assumptions** or limitations related to preprocessing

---

### 6. **Exploratory Feature-Target Association**

This section focuses on **identifying relationships** between input variables and the outcome variable.

#### a. **Categorical Features**

* **Tests**: Chi-squared test of independence, Cram√©r‚Äôs V
* **Visuals**: Grouped bar plots, mosaic plots
* **Insights**: ‚ÄúChest pain type and gender are significantly associated with heart disease severity (p < 0.01).‚Äù

#### b. **Numerical Features**

* **Tests**: ANOVA, t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis, correlation (Pearson, Spearman)
* **Visuals**: Boxplots by target level, violin plots, scatterplots
* **Insights**: ‚ÄúCholesterol and ST depression show moderate correlation with severity (œÅ = 0.48, p < 0.001).‚Äù

#### c. **Feature-Feature Interactions**

* Two-way ANOVA, stratified analysis, grouped scatterplots, or heatmaps
* ‚ÄúThe interaction between age and thalach significantly differentiates severity levels.‚Äù

---

### 7. **Root Cause Analysis**

Delve deeper into **multi-variable interactions or stratified behavior** using the following methods:

#### a. **Multivariate Group Comparisons**

* Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)
* Feature aggregation by target class
* Clustered heatmaps for subgroup profiles

#### b. **Explainable Modeling for Diagnostic Insight** *(Avoiding predictive intent)*

* **Logistic regression coefficients** (interpreted diagnostically: e.g., ‚ÄúSmoking increases odds of severity 3 by 2.3x‚Äù)
* **Tree-based model feature splits** (used for interpretability, not prediction)
* **SHAP values** *(used only for exploratory root cause narratives, e.g., ‚ÄúCholesterol and age drive class 4 diagnoses‚Äù)*

> üü° Emphasize: "Model used for explanation only, not prediction. See Predictive Report for forecasting."

---

### 8. **Subgroup & Disparity Analysis**

* Gender-based differences in associations
* Region-wise profile comparisons (Cleveland vs Hungary)
* Age-stratified interaction terms
* Outlier subgroup profiling (e.g., ‚ÄúYoung patients with severe disease‚Äù)

---

### 9. **Anomaly Detection & Edge Cases**

* Z-score or IQR-based outliers
* Isolation Forest or LOF (Local Outlier Factor)
* Profile unexpected records:

  * ‚ÄúPatients with low cholesterol but high disease severity‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúResting ECG abnormalities with no prior symptoms‚Äù

---

### 10. **Key Findings & Interpretations**

For each question explored, provide:

* Diagnostic Finding
* Supporting Evidence (statistical result or visual)
* Implication (clinical or operational relevance)

| Diagnostic Question                    | Key Insight                         | Supporting Evidence    | Interpretation                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| How does age affect severity?          | Older age linked to higher severity | ANOVA: F=22.6, p<0.001 | Elder patients need closer monitoring  |
| What drives asymptomatic severe cases? | High cholesterol + oldpeak          | Logistic model, SHAP   | Silent risk, early screenings critical |

---

### 11. **Limitations**

* Data completeness
* Confounders not measured (e.g., genetic info, medication history)
* Interpretive limitations of non-random samples

---

### 12. **Recommendations & Strategic Implications**

* Clinical actions (e.g., ‚ÄúFlag patients >60 with exang=1 for early testing‚Äù)
* Data collection improvements
* Prepare features for predictive modeling

---

### 13. **Appendices**

* Detailed test results
* Full statistical tables
* Data dictionary
* Model assumptions or formulas

---

### 14. **Technical Metadata (Optional)**

* Tools: Python (`pandas`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `shap`, etc.)
* Runtime environment (e.g., Jupyter + HTML export)
* Date generated, script version

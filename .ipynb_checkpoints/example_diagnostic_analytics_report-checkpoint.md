# 📝 **Diagnostic Analytics Report**

## Investigating Root Causes of Heart Disease Severity

### Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (UCI Repository)

**Prepared by**: \[Your Name or Team]
**Date**: July 2025
**Version**: 1.0

## 📄 Executive Summary

This diagnostic analytics report explores the **key factors and interactions** associated with the **presence and severity of heart disease** in patients from the Cleveland dataset. Using statistical tests and model-based explainability tools, we identify the **most influential variables**, examine **gender and age disparities**, and explore **feature interactions** that may contribute to disease risk.

Key findings include:

* **Chest pain type**, **exercise-induced angina**, and **ST depression** are the strongest indicators of disease severity.
* Males over 55 exhibit the highest rates of heart disease.
* The **combined effect of age and maximum heart rate** explains much of the variation in moderate-to-severe disease cases.

Based on these findings, we recommend revisiting screening protocols to prioritize high-risk combinations and to ensure that subtle clinical indicators are not overlooked.

## 📚 Introduction

The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, comprising 303 patient records and 14 clinical features, offers a valuable opportunity to examine root causes of cardiovascular disease severity. While previous analyses often focus on prediction, this report takes a **diagnostic approach**: understanding **why** certain individuals develop more severe forms of the disease.

This analysis supports clinical decision-making by identifying the features that most influence disease severity, helping clinicians target early interventions and refine screening strategies.

## 🧪 Data and Methodology

### 🔹 Data Overview

* **Dataset**: Cleveland subset of UCI Heart Disease dataset
* **Target**: `num` (0 = no disease, 1–4 = increasing severity)
* **Records**: 303 patients
* **Selected Features**:

  * Demographics: `age`, `sex`
  * Symptoms & diagnostics: `cp`, `exang`, `oldpeak`, `thalach`, `restecg`, `thal`
  * Blood work: `chol`, `trestbps`, `fbs`

### 🔹 Diagnostic Approach

* **Univariate tests**:

  * *Chi-squared* (categorical features)
  * *ANOVA / Kruskal-Wallis* (continuous features vs. severity)
* **Multivariate modeling**:

  * *Ordinal Logistic Regression* (target: severity)
  * *Random Forest* for feature importance
  * *SHAP* for model explainability
* **Subgroup comparisons**:

  * Gender-based differences
  * Age group stratification
* **Missing Data Handling**:

  * Minimal missingness handled via row exclusion or type conversion (e.g., `"?"` → NaN)

## 📊 Analysis and Findings

### 🔹 1. Key Influential Features

* **Chest Pain Type (`cp`)**:

  * Patients with asymptomatic chest pain (type 4) had significantly higher severity scores (p < 0.001).
* **Exercise-Induced Angina (`exang`)**:

  * 71% of severe cases reported angina during exercise vs. 21% in non-severe cases (chi-squared p < 0.01).
* **ST Depression (`oldpeak`)**:

  * Higher ST depression correlates with increased severity (Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.001).

### 🔹 2. Feature Interactions

* **Age + Maximum Heart Rate (`thalach`)**:

  * Older patients with low `thalach` are at much higher risk — visible in SHAP interaction plots.
* **Cholesterol + Chest Pain**:

  * High cholesterol alone is not a strong indicator unless paired with non-typical chest pain types.

### 🔹 3. Gender Differences

* **Males** accounted for 84% of cases with severity ≥ 2.
* However, females with high ST depression had a disproportionately higher severity than males with the same `oldpeak` values, suggesting a **gender interaction effect**.

### 🔹 4. Multivariate Model Summary

* Ordinal Logistic Regression:

  * Top predictors: `cp`, `exang`, `oldpeak`, `age`, `thalach`
  * Model pseudo R² = 0.41
* SHAP:

  * Most influential features: `cp`, `oldpeak`, `thal`, `exang`
  * Strong nonlinear effects observed in `oldpeak` and `thalach`

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on these diagnostic findings, we recommend the following:

1. **Enhance Screening for High-Risk Groups**

   * Prioritize patients >55 with atypical chest pain, high ST depression, and exercise-induced angina for further testing.

2. **Incorporate Interaction Effects in Risk Scoring Tools**

   * Risk assessment algorithms should reflect **joint effects** (e.g., age × max heart rate) rather than evaluating features independently.

3. **Gender-Sensitive Risk Adjustment**

   * Update clinical triage protocols to better detect underdiagnosed women with ST depression and mild symptoms.

4. **Education and Clinical Decision Support**

   * Train care teams to recognize high-risk patterns that are not obvious individually but significant when combined.

5. **Further Investigation into Feature Gaps**

   * Consider diagnostic follow-up on features with weak or non-significant associations (e.g., fasting blood sugar), as their clinical utility may need reevaluation.

## 🔚 Conclusion

This diagnostic analytics report identifies key drivers of heart disease severity using the Cleveland dataset. The findings reinforce the importance of chest pain types, stress response indicators, and age-related interactions in clinical decision-making. Future work should validate these findings with larger, more diverse datasets and incorporate these insights into real-world risk assessment tools and triage systems.

By understanding *why* certain patients develop severe heart disease, healthcare teams can act earlier and more precisely — leading to improved outcomes and resource optimization.
